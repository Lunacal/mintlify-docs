What “Disable Cancellation / Rescheduling” Means

- By default, clients may be allowed to cancel or reschedule their booked events. With these settings:

“**Disable Cancelling**” — prevents clients from canceling once a booking is confirmed.

“**Disable Rescheduling**” — prevents clients from changing the time/date of a confirmed booking.

🔄 **What Happens to Existing Bookings & How It Affects Clients**

- For new bookings after you enable the toggle: Clients will not see options to cancel or reschedule.

- For existing bookings (before you enabled the toggle): They remain unaffected and attendee can reschedule/cancel bookings.

- Clients trying to cancel/reschedule: They will not have the option on their booking page (or the links/buttons will be disabled).

- If a booking needs to be rescheduled/cancelled by you (**the host**), you can still do it via your [bookings](https://app.lunacal.ai/bookings/upcoming).
