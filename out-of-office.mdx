Use **Out of Office** to prevent new bookings during your absence or to automatically forward those bookings to a teammate for coverage. This ensures clients can’t accidentally book time when you’re unavailable, and that urgent requests still get handled.

## Step 1

Open “[**Settings**](https://app.lunacal.ai/new-settings?tabName=general)”, scroll to “**Out of Office**”, and click “**Add**”.

## Step 2

Select your away dates (start and end).\
**Example**: You’re off from 1 July to 10 July—set those dates so no one books you during that period.

## Step 3

If you’re in a team, choose a member to receive your bookings while you’re away.\
**Example**: Forward sales calls to your teammate who covers your region to keep deals moving.

> **Note:** Only the team owner or admins can set or edit out-of-office settings for other team members. If you don’t have the right permissions, you may need to ask a team admin to configure this for you.

## Step 4

Click “**Create**” to confirm.\
**Example**: Traveling without reliable internet? Create the **out-of-office** now so reminders and invites route correctly.

## Step 5

Your out of office is **active**.\
**Example**: Midweek return? Set the end date to Wednesday so Thursday and Friday reopen automatically.

When **Out of Office** is active:

- Your booking page will block new bookings for the selected dates.
- If you selected a team member for coverage, booking requests will be routed to them instead.
- Calendar integrations and reminders remain active — only scheduling availability is paused.

## Edit or Remove Out of Office

If your plans change:

1. Open **Settings → Out of Office**.
2. Click on the active out of office period.
3. Update the start/end dates or remove it entirely. This immediately re-opens your availability if the dates are changed or removed.

### Troubleshooting

- **Still seeing availability on your booking page?** Make sure the start/end dates are correct and that the Out of Office was saved.
- **Coverage not forwarding bookings?** Confirm the teammate you selected is active and has availability.
- **Bookings still go through for certain slots?** Check if minimum notice settings or booking limits override the out-of-office block.

### **Common mistakes to avoid**

- Leaving the end date blank or incorrect, which keeps your calendar blocked longer than intended.
- Forgetting to pick a teammate when coverage is needed, causing missed calls or delays.
- Setting dates in the wrong order (end before start), which prevents activation.

### **Good defaults to start with**

- Start date = first full day you’re unavailable; End date = last day you’re away.
- If you handle time-sensitive leads, select a teammate for coverage by default.
- Create the out-of-office a day before travel to catch last-minute bookings.
