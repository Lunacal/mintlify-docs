## Step 2

Select your away dates (start and end).\
Example: You’re off from 1 July to 10 July—set those dates so no one books you during that period.

## Step 3

If you’re in a team, choose a member to receive your bookings while you’re away.\
Example: Forward sales calls to your teammate who covers your region to keep deals moving.

## Step 4

Click “Create” to confirm.\
Example: Traveling without reliable internet? Create the out-of-office now so reminders and invites route correctly.

## Step 5

Your out of office is active.\
Example: Midweek return? Set the end date to Wednesday so Thursday and Friday reopen automatically.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Leaving the end date blank or incorrect, which keeps your calendar blocked longer than intended.
- Forgetting to pick a teammate when coverage is needed, causing missed calls or delays.
- Setting dates in the wrong order (end before start), which prevents activation.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Start date = first full day you’re unavailable; End date = last day you’re away.
- If you handle time-sensitive leads, select a teammate for coverage by default.
- Create the out-of-office a day before travel to catch last-minute bookings.
