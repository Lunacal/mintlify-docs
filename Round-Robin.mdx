**When to use Round Robin vs other options (quick guide)**

Use when any qualified team member can take the meeting and you want fair distribution and fast first response.\
**Examples:** Inbound product demos, support callbacks, clinic “general consult” pool, discovery calls.

Use "Collective Scheduling" when the meeting must include multiple hosts (e.g., panel interview, complex demo with SE).

**Step 1**

Click on "Create a new event".

**Step 2**

Select "Round Robin " from the "Assignment" options.

Example Sales team with 4 reps: every new demo rotates through Rep A → Rep B → Rep C → Rep D, then loops back.

**Step 3**

The "Event Setup", "Booking Limits", and other settings work the same way as a regular event.

Example Keep your usual buffers and advance notice in "Booking Limits" so last-minute bookings don’t overload the next person in line.

**Step 4**

Go to the "Assignment" section.

**Step 5**

"Round-Robin Hosts"

Turn ON → All current and future team members are automatically included in the rotation.

Turn OFF → Manually select which team members will be part of the rotation.

"Default Hosts"

A Default Host is a team member who will be added to every meeting in this event (co-host on all bookings).

Examples

Support triage: keep "Round-Robin Hosts" ON so new hires auto-join the rotation; add a senior agent as "Default Host" to shadow first month.

Clinic intake: rotate among 3 junior doctors, but add the senior doctor as "Default Host" for first-visit consultations.

**Step 6**

"Availability Options"

"Choose a Common Schedule (ON)": All hosts follow the same availability you set here. Any changes apply to all linked events.

</Frame>

"Choose a Common Schedule (OFF)": Each host uses their own individual availability for this event.

</Frame>

Example Global team: set "Choose a Common Schedule (OFF)" so each host’s personal hours are respected; Lunacal still rotates to the next host who’s free.


**Common mistakes to avoid**

Turning "Round-Robin Hosts" ON but leaving some members with no availability; they’ll never receive bookings.

Forgetting buffers in "Booking Limits", causing back-to-back assignments for whoever is next.

Adding a "Default Host" unintentionally and wondering why one person appears on every invite.

Mixing "Choose a Common Schedule (ON)" with hosts who need different time zones; use OFF for individual schedules.

Leaving future hires out when "Round-Robin Hosts" is OFF; remember to add them manually.
