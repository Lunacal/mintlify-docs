### **Use-cases:**

- You have multiple independent companies which require independent scheduling pages
- You run an agency with multiple clients, who need independent scheduling options
- You’re a consultant/freelancer working with several companies.

> ## Using Teams feature, you can create multiple companies, each of which can have its own users and scheduling pages

## This help doc is divided into 4 sections:

1. Section 1: Create a new team for Company 1 and invite members
2. Section 2: Members will accept the invite and join the team
3. Section 3: Repeat this process for Company 2
4. Section 4: Create events and scheduling pages for each company

# <u>Section 1: Create a new team for every company and invite members</u>

## Step 1

Navigate to the "Teams Section" and click on “Create a New Team.”

</Frame>

## **Step 3**

Enter the email address (or multiple addresses) of the team members you want to add.

- If you are an agency and have a client who has 2 team members whom you want to invite, then add the email IDs of both of those people
- If you're a solopreneur working for another company B, then invite the email ID associated with the other company

**Note:** Every email Id who is being invited will consume 1 license/user from your plan, so you need to have multiple users in your plan for this to work.

# **<u>Section 2: Members will accept the invite and join the team</u>**

## **Step 4**

</Frame>

## **Step 10**

This is the same process as above  members accept the invite, create an account if needed, and join the team.

## **Step 11**

Now you have 3 companies set up: 1 in your primary account + 2 new teams that you have set up.

</Frame>


# **<u>Section 4:</u>**<u> Create events and scheduling pages for each company</u>

## Step 12

You now have multiple members, each of whom have their own subscription. They can create their own scheduling pages and events

To do this, they can go to 'Event Types' and create new event.

Also, they will have their own settings, scheduling pages, availability, integration, etc.

Important: Please note that every member whom you've added has their own licenses and can create their own events.

# <u>EXAMPLE</u>

Say you run an agency and have 2 clients:

- 'New Age Salon' which has 4 barbers - Jeff, Linda, Tara, Amy
- 'Dr. Dave Matthews' who is an individual doctor

To set this up:

You will create 2 teams - Team 1 will have 4 users - so you'll have to invite all 4 members. Team 2 will have 1 member - Dr. Dave

This will consume 5 users/licenses from your account (4+1). Members from 'New Age Salon' will not be able to see anything about Dr. Dave and vice versa

When the members accept the invite, they'll be upgraded to the paid plan automatically

**<u>For Dr. Dave</u>**

Since Dr. Dave is an individual, they'll go to 'Event Types' and create their own events. See this link for more details:  https://help.lunacal.ai/event-types/event-setup

There is no need for any Team events

**<u>For 'New Age Salon'</u>**

- All 4 barbers can create their own events like Dr. Dave and share links with clients
- Additionally, you can also create a [Team booking page](https://help.lunacal.ai/Teambooking-page), where all 4 members are listed. The overall Team page of the salon can be shared with the clients who can select the member they want to book
- If you don't want to give clients the option to select a specific barber and want to automatically assign barbers, you can create a [round-robin event](https://help.lunacal.ai/Round-Robin) where barbers are automatically assigned whenever someone does a booking
