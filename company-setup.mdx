## Why Use Teams for Companies?

If you manage or work with multiple companies, Lunacal’s **Teams** feature helps you keep everything separate and organized.

- Each company can have its own **team**.
- Only members of that company can access its **events**.
- This makes it easier to manage schedules, clients, and internal bookings without overlap.

## Three main steps:

1. **Create a Company Team** – Make a dedicated team for each company.
2. **Invite & Approve Members** – Add members by email, and they join by accepting the invite.
3. **Keep Companies Separate** – Repeat the process for other companies so each has its own team and events.

## Creating a Company Team

## Step 1

Navigate to the "Teams Section" and click on “Create a New Team.”
