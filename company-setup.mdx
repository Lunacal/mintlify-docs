## Use Cases

> This guide is useful if you want to manage scheduling for more than one business or client under a single lunacal account.

Using the **Teams** feature, you can create multiple companies, each of which can have its own users and scheduling pages.

Common use cases:

- You have multiple independent companies that require independent scheduling pages.
- You run an agency with multiple clients, who each need their own scheduling options.
- You’re a consultant/freelancer working with several companies.

> In lunacal, each company is represented as a separate **Team**. Each team has its own members, events, scheduling pages, and settings.

## This help doc is divided into 4 sections:

1. **Section 1:** Create a new team for Company 1 and invite members
2. **Section 2:** Members will accept the invite and join the team
3. **Section 3:** Repeat this process for Company 2
4. **Section 4:** Create events and scheduling pages for each company

## <u>Section 1: Create a New Team for every company and invite Members</u>

## Section 4: Create Events and Scheduling Pages for Each Company

Step 11\
Each member has their own subscription and can create their own scheduling pages and events.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/company-setup/CT12.webp)
</Frame>

To do this, they can go to **“Event Types”** and create a new event.\\

<Frame>
  ![](/images/company-setup/CT12.webp)
</Frame>

They will also have their own settings, scheduling pages, availability, integrations, etc.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/company-setup/CT13.webp)
</Frame>

**Important:** Every member you add consumes a license and can create their own events.

## Example

Say you run an agency and have 2 clients:

- **New Age Salon** with 4 barbers (Jeff, Linda, Tara, Amy)
- **Dr. Dave Matthews**, an individual doctor

Setup process:

- Create **Team 1 (New Age Salon)** → invite all 4 barbers → consumes 4 licenses.
- Create **Team 2 (Dr. Dave)** → invite Dr. Dave → consumes 1 license.

Total = 5 licenses (4 + 1).

### How it works:

- Members of **New Age Salon** cannot see Dr. Dave’s details, and vice versa.
- When members accept the invite, they are upgraded to the paid plan automatically.

For Dr. Dave:

- Dr. Dave goes to **Event Types** and creates his own events.
- No need for Team events.

For New Age Salon:

- Each barber can create their own events (just like Dr. Dave).
- You can also create a **Team Booking Page** where all 4 members are listed. Clients can select a barber directly.
- If you don’t want clients to choose, you can create a **Round Robin Event** so barbers are automatically assigned whenever someone books.
