### **Use-cases:**

- You have multiple independent companies which require independent scheduling pages
- You run an agency with multiple clients, who need independent scheduling options
- You’re a consultant/freelancer working with several companies.

> ## Using **Teams** feature, you can create multiple companies, each of which can have its own users and scheduling pages

## This help doc is divided into 4 sections:

1. **Section 1:** Create a new team for Company 1 and invite members
2. **Section 2: **Members will accept the invite and join the team
3. **Section 3: **Repeat this process for Company 2
4. **Section 4**: Create events and scheduling pages for each company

# <u>Section 1</u>: Create a new team for every company and invite members

## Step 1

Navigate to the "Teams Section" and click on “Create a New Team.”

## Step 3

Enter the email address (or multiple addresses) of the team members you want to add.

- If you are an agency and have a client who has 2 team members whom you want to invite, then add the email IDs of both of those people
- If you're a solopreneur working for another company B, then invite the email ID associated with the other company

Note: Every email Id who is being invited will consume 1 license/user from your plan, so you need to have multiple users in your plan for this to work.
