## Overview

With Lunacal.ai’s Zapier integration, you can automate workflows that respond to booking events. This guide walks you through setting up a Zap that captures UTM data from your booking form and writes it directly into a Google Sheet — helping you keep track of marketing sources effortlessly.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you start:

- A [Zapier](https://zapier.com) account
- A [Lunacal.ai](https://lunacal.ai) account
- A Google account with access to Google Sheets
- A sheet already created with columns like: `Name`, `UTM Source`, `Email`

## 🔌 Step 1: Connect Zapier in Lunacal.ai

1. Log in to your Lunacal dashboard.
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Integrations**.
3. Select **Automation** from the integration categories.
4. Click the **Connect** button on the **Zapier** card to initiate the connection.

## ⚙️ Step 4: Build Your Zap Workflow

### 4.1 Set up the Trigger

1. Click **\+ Create Zap** in Zapier.

3. Under **Event**, choose `Booking Created`.
4. Choose the Lunacal account you just connected.

### 4.2 Set up the Action with Google Sheets

Now we’ll write this booking data to a Google Sheet.

1. In the **Action** step, search for and select `Google Sheets`.
2. Choose the action event: **Create Spreadsheet Row**.
3. Connect your Google account if you haven’t already.
4. Select the spreadsheet and worksheet where the data should go.
5. Ensure the sheet has the following columns created beforehand:
   - `Name`
   - `UTM Source`
   - `Email`

> **Note:** You can add more fields like `UTM Campaign`, `UTM Medium`, etc. These must exist in the sheet before proceeding.
