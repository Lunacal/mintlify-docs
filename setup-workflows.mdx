lunacal supports both **email and SMS workflows** so you can automate reminders, confirmations, and follow-ups via text message in addition to email. SMS workflows are especially helpful for reducing no-shows by delivering reminders directly to attendees' phones.

## Step 1

Go to the [Workflows](https://app.lunacal.ai/new-settings?tabName=workflows) tab and click **Create New Workflow**

> Note: You can't create more than 10 Workflows

## Step 2

Provide a unique name for your workflow in the designated field.

## Step 3

Determine the event type to which the workflow will apply. For instance i'm selecting "**Meeting**", You can also select **multiple events**.

## Step 5

Pick a trigger:

- **Before an event starts**
- **When event is canceled**
- **When new event is booked**
- **After event ends**
- **When event is rescheduled**

> **Example**: Send a reminder “Before an event starts” so attendees don’t miss the call.

Workflows can send either email or SMS messages. When you select an action like “Send message”, you’ll be able to choose whether the notification is sent via email, SMS, or both.

- Keep in mind that SMS messages are billed based on message length and destination country — longer messages or certain carriers may use more than one SMS segment. [SMS Pricing](https://help.lunacal.ai/sms-workflows-reminder)

> **Triggers** are events in lunacal that start an automated workflow (for example, when a new booking occurs, when an event is canceled, when an event is rescheduled, or a set time before an event starts).

> **Actions** are what your workflow does after it’s triggered — like sending an email or SMS reminder.

**Common workflow examples**

- Send an **SMS** + **email** reminder **24 hours before a meeting**
- Notify the host via **email** when a booking is canceled
- Send an **SMS** follow-up after a meeting ends

## Step 6

If using a “**Before an event starts**” trigger, you have to set the time (**e.g., 2 Hours**).

- **Example**: For first-time “**Meeting**” calls, set 24 Hours so people prep earlier.

## Step 7

Specify the recipients of the workflow trigger.

## Step 8

Select “**attendees**”, “**host**”, or add a **specific email**, and for **sms** currently there's only one option **Send SMS to attendee**.

- **Example**: Add your coordinator’s email so they get alerts for last-minute changes.

## Step 9

There are multiple **templates** options to set for attendee workflow emails.

> \*\*Note: \*\*You can't edit SMS template.

</Frame>

## Step 10

Insert variables as needed **Variable examples**

- `ATTENDEE_NAME` — the name of the attendee
- `EVENT_TIME` — the scheduled time of the event
- `LOCATION_LINK` — conferencing link or location

## Step 11

Click “**Save**” to activate the workflow.

**Testing your workflow** After saving, perform a real or test booking that matches the trigger conditions (for example, book a meeting or cancel one). Check that the email or SMS messages are sent as expected to all recipients. Adjust timing, variables, or recipients if needed.

**Tips for SMS workflows**

- Keep SMS messages concise to reduce cost (short messages are typically 1 segment, long messages may cost more).
- Include key details like date, time, and event name in your SMS.
- Test SMS workflows with a real booking to verify delivery before rolling them out broadly.

**Example SMS workflows**

- Send an SMS reminder 24 hours before the event start.
- Send a confirmation SMS immediately after booking is completed.
- Deliver a follow-up SMS after the meeting ends.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Picking a trigger but forgetting to set time for “Before an event starts”, which sends nothing.
- Selecting “host” only when you meant to notify “attendees” as well.
- Leaving variables blank (for example, missing LOCATION_LINK) so emails are unclear.
- Creating overlapping reminders (for example, two reminders at 1 Hour) and spamming recipients.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Triggers: “When new event is booked” (instant confirmation) and “Before an event starts” at 24 Hours + 1 Hour.
- Recipients: “attendees” for reminders, “host” for reschedule/cancel alerts.
- Variables: always include ATTENDEE_NAME, EVENT_TIME, LOCATION_LINK.
- Naming: include event and timing in the name (for example, “Meeting — Reminder 24h”).
