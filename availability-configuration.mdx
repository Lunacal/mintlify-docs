## Step 1

To create a new availability, go to [**Availability**](https://app.lunacal.ai/new-settings?tabName=availability).

## Step 2

You’ll see a default schedule. Click “**Create New Availability**”.

  ![](/images/setup_availability/2.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 3

Enter a name (for example, “**Introduction**”) and click “**Continue**”.

</Frame>

## Step 4

Adjust your default working hours (for example, **9:00 AM–5:00 PM**) and turn specific days on or off.\
Any day you disable won’t appear on your booking page.\
**Example:** If you work **Monday** to **Thursday**, disable Friday to Sunday so no one can book on those days.

## Step 5

If you work in multiple shifts, click the **plus (+)** icon to add separate time slots.\
For example, if your schedule is **8:00 AM–11:30 AM** and **12:00 PM–2:00 PM**, add both time slots to define your availability clearly. \*\*Attendees \*\*will then be able to book during those time slots only.

## Step 6

You can copy your working hours to other days if the schedule is the same.\
Click the **copy** icon, select the days you want to apply the same hours, and click **Apply**.

**Example:**\
If your Monday schedule is **9:00 AM–5:00 PM**, and you work the same hours Tuesday to Thursday, copy Monday’s timings to those days instead of adding them manually.

## Step 7

Availability Exception : This lets you block specific dates or times when you’re unavailable, even if those fall within your regular working hours. It’s useful for holidays, breaks, or one-off days off.

To add an exception, click **Add Exception**.

## Step 8

A calendar view will appear where you can select specific dates and set the times you’re unavailable for that day.\
**Example**: If you’re unavailable the entire day, check the **Mark Unavailable (All Day)** option.

## Step 10

Click “**Save**” to store your changes.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/setup_availability/10.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 11

Your availability configuration is now completed.\
\
On the **Availability Dashboard**, you’ll see all the availabilities you’ve set up.\
Click the **three dots (⋮)** next to any availability to:

1. **Set as Default** – Make it your default availability.
2. **Duplicate** – Create a copy from an existing availability.
3. **Delete** – Remove an availability you no longer need.

## Step 12

You can also update availability settings directly from your **Event Types**.\
Go to the **Event Types** section, select the event you want, and adjust its availability as needed.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/setup_availability/selectevent.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 13

Use the dropdown to select one of your saved availabilities — for example, **“Introduction.”**\
The selected availability will apply to the specific event type you’re configuring, so that event will follow the same working hours and rules.

## Step 14

Review your settings and click "**Save**."

**Common mistakes to avoid :**\
• Forgetting to click “Apply” before “Save”, which can discard your latest hour edits.\
• Leaving a day toggled on with empty hours, which can hide availability or cause confusion.\
• Forgetting to set an availability exception for holidays or one-off days off. If you skip this, attendees may still be able to book meetings on days you’re actually unavailable.\
• Using “Mark Unavailable” on the wrong date when adding an exception.\
• Not selecting your new availability in the event type dropdown, so the event still uses an old schedule.

**Good defaults to start with :**\
• Hours: **10:00 AM–6:00 PM**, Mon–Fri; turn Sat–Sun off.\
• Split day: add a 30-minute mid-day break to avoid back-to-backs.\
• Exceptions: add known holidays and travel days for the next 60–90 days now.\
• Event types: map “**Introduction**” to short meetings; use a separate availability for longer sessions.
