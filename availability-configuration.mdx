## Step 4

Adjust the default hours (usually 9:00 AM–5:00 PM). Turn days on or off as needed.\
Example: You work Mon–Thu only. Disable Fri–Sun and shift Mon–Thu to 10:00 AM–6:00 PM.

## Step 5

Add more time slots if your day is split. For example, 8:00 AM–11:30 AM and 12:00 PM–2:00 PM.\
Example: You teach a class 11:30 AM–12:00 PM, so add two slots around it. This avoids mid-day bookings.

## Step 6

Copy these timings to other days if the pattern repeats.\
Example: If Tue–Thu share the same hours, set it once and copy to those days. Saves time.

## Step 13

Use the dropdown to choose the availability you created (for example, “Introduction”).\
Example: You have two event types—“Intro Call” and “Deep-dive”. Assign a shorter slot set to “Intro Call” and a wider window to “Deep-dive” so both get realistic times.
