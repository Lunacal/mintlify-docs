## Step 4

In the "**Event Setup**" section, you'll see **Duration** \
**Note**: Pricing doesn’t change with duration

Currently, duration selection doesn’t affect pricing: even if invitees choose a longer meeting duration under Flexible Duration, the price remains the same. if you need different pricing for different durations, you must create separate event types (or wait for future feature updates).\\
