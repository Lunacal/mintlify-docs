## Step 1

On “Event Types”, select the event type you want to edit. You can click anywhere on the square box or use the gear button.

Click “Booking Limits”.

## Step 3

In “**Booking Limits**”, set a buffer before event and buffer after event meetings. You can choose up to 120 minutes for both before and after buffers.\
Example: Add a 10-minute buffer before a demo to review notes and open your deck. 🕒

## Step 4

Set a buffer after event to avoid back-to-back calls.\
Example: Add 15–20 minutes after a sales call to write follow-up points and reset.

## Step 5

In the **Advance Notice** section, define the minimum notice lead time before someone can book you. This prevents last-minute bookings (for example, within the next hour). You can set the notice in minutes, hours, or days.\
Example: Require at least 2 hours’ notice so you’re not surprised by immediate bookings.

## Step 6

Limit booking frequency on "**Max Bookings per Event**" to control how many times someone can book you within a period. You can restrict to one booking per day, week, month, or year, and you can add multiple limits (up to 4) for an event.\
Example: Cap coaching to 2 sessions per week per person to manage workload.

## Step 7

Set the “**Advance Booking Limit**” to control how far into the future people can see and book. You can allow booking within 30 days or specify the exact days you want open.\
Example: Show only the next 30 days so your calendar doesn’t get locked months ahead. 💡

Once all settings are in place, click the "Save" button to apply your limits and buffer settings.

**Common mistakes to avoid :**\
• Forgetting to click “Save”, which leaves old settings active.\
• Setting buffers but leaving the advance notice at “0”, allowing last-minute bookings anyway.\
• Adding overlapping frequency limits (e.g., 1 per day and 1 per 24 hours) that confuse availability.\
• Setting a very short “Advance Booking Limit” (e.g., 3 days) and then wondering why next week looks unavailable.

**Good defaults to start with :**\
• Buffers: 10 minutes before, 15 minutes after.\
• Advance notice: 2 hours (same-day safety net).\
• Booking frequency: 1 per day per person for longer sessions; none for quick 15-minute chats.\
• “Advance Booking Limit”: 30 days (opens rolling availability without overcommitting).
