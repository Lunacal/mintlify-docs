## What is a One-time / Limited-use Booking Link?

When enabled, Lunacal generates a **unique booking link** for your event type. You can decide how many bookings are allowed through this link:

- **One-time link** → Only 1 booking allowed
- **Limited-use link** → Allow multiple bookings by increasing the usage limit

Once the usage limit is reached, the link automatically becomes inactive.

> ⚠️ Note: Only the **host** can create and manage one-time or limited-use booking links.

## How to Create a One-time or Limited-use Booking Link

1. Go to your [**Event Type**](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types).
2. Click on the **Share** button.
3. Enable **Create a single-use or limited-use Booking Link**.
4. A **unique booking URL** will be generated automatically.
5. Under **Max Booking Limit**, set how many bookings are allowed:
   - Set it to **1** for a one-time booking link
   - Increase the number if you want multiple bookings using the same link
6. Copy the generated link and share it with your attendee(s).

## How It Works for Attendees

- Attendees can book normally using the shared link.
- Each successful booking reduces the available usage count.
- Once the limit is reached, no further bookings can be made using that link.

## Viewing & Managing Past Booking Links

You can view all previously generated unique booking links:

1. Open the **Share** modal for the event type.
2. Click on **Past links**.
3. Here you can see:
   - The unique booking link
   - Usage count (e.g., `0 / 1`, `1 / 3`)
4. You can also **delete** a link if it’s no longer needed.

## Common Use Cases

- Sharing a **private booking link** with a specific client
- Sending a **one-time meeting link** via email or DM
- Limiting bookings for **exclusive sessions or trials**
- Preventing overbooking when sharing links publicly

If you need to allow more bookings later, simply generate a new limited-use link or increase the usage limit while creating the link.
