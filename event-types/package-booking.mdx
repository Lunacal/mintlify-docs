## What is Package Booking?

Package Booking lets hosts offer **multiple time slots as part of a single booking**.\
Instead of booking one meeting at a time, attendees can select several slots in one flow.

Package Booking can be enabled for:

- **Individual (normal) events**
- **Team events** (except **Collective Scheduling** events)

> **Note:** Package Booking is not supported for Collective events because collective availability requires all members to be available for every slot.

| Feature                  | **Fixed Slot Package**                                 | **Flexible Slot Package**                            |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Slot count               | Host sets an **exact number** of slots                 | Host sets a **minimum and maximum range**            |
| Attendee choice          | Must select **exactly the defined number** of slots    | Can select **any number within the allowed range**   |
| Booking condition        | Booking completes **only when all slots are selected** | Booking completes once selection is within the range |
| Example setup            | 4 slots                                                | 2–6 slots                                            |
| Example attendee action  | Must book **exactly 4 sessions**                       | Can book **2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 sessions**               |
| Flexibility for attendee | ❌ Low                                                  | ✅ High                                               |
| Best for                 | Fixed programs, paid bundles, structured courses       | Coaching, mentoring, flexible engagement packages    |
| Pricing alignment        | Easy to price per package                              | Useful when pricing depends on session count         |
| Risk of partial booking  | None (strict requirement)                              | Possible if expectations aren’t clearly communicated |
