## Creating a Coupon

You’ll need to fill in the following details:

| **Coupon Code**                                                       | **Discount Type & Value**                                               | **Expiration Date**                                 | **Usage Limit**                         |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Unique promo code entered by attendees at checkout (e.g. `WELCOME80`) | Percentage-based discount (**e.g. 80%**). **100% discount not allowed** | Date after which the coupon becomes invalid/expired | Number of times the coupon can be used. |

## How Coupons Work for Attendees

- Attendees can apply the coupon code during checkout
- The discount is applied instantly to the final price
- If the coupon is expired or usage limit is exceeded, it won’t be accepted

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Coupons work only when payments are enabled for the event
- 100% discount coupons are not supported
- Coupons are specific to the event type they are created for

This helps you control pricing while still keeping payments and access secure.
