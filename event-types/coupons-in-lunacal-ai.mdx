## Where to find Coupons

Coupons are configured at the **Event Type** level.

1. Go to **Event Types**
2. Open the event type you want to configure
3. Navigate to **Payments**
4. Inside Payments, you’ll find the **Coupons**

> **Important:** Coupons are available only for paid events.

## Prerequisite: Enable Payments

If the **Payment App** toggle is turned **off**, you will not be able to **create coupons**.

To **enable coupon** creation:

1. Go to **Event Type → Payments**
2. Turn **ON** the toggle
3. Once enabled, the **Create Coupon** button becomes **active**.

## Creating a Coupon

Click **Create Coupon** to open the coupon creation modal.

You’ll need to fill in the following details:

### 1. Coupon Code

- A unique promo code that attendees will enter during checkout
- Example: `FIRSTMEET20`

### 2. Discount Type

- Select **Percentage**
- Enter the discount value (for example, 40%)

> **Note:** Coupons with a **100% discount are not allowed**.

### 3. Expiration Date

- Set an optional expiry date for the coupon
- After this date, the coupon will no longer be valid

### 4. Usage Limit

- Define how many times the coupon can be used
- Once the limit is reached, the coupon automatically becomes inactive

After entering all the details, click **Create** to save the coupon.

## How Coupons Work for Attendees

- Attendees can apply the coupon code during checkout
- The discount is applied instantly to the final price
- If the coupon is expired or usage limit is exceeded, it won’t be accepted

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Coupons work only when payments are enabled for the event
- 100% discount coupons are not supported
- Coupons are specific to the event type they are created for

This helps you control pricing while still keeping payments and access secure.
