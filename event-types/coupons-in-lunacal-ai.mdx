## Creating a Coupon

You’ll need to fill in the following details:

| **Coupon Code**                                                       | **Discount Type & Value**                                               | **Expiration Date**                                 | **Usage Limit**                         |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Unique promo code entered by attendees at checkout (e.g. `WELCOME80`) | Percentage-based discount (**e.g. 80%**). **100% discount not allowed** | Date after which the coupon becomes invalid/expired | Number of times the coupon can be used. |

**Discount types explained**
- **Percentage discount** – Reduces the event price by a percentage (e.g., 80% off).  
- **Fixed amount discount** – Deducts a fixed amount from the event price (e.g., $10 off).

> Note: You cannot combine percentage and amount discounts in a single coupon.

## How Coupons Work for Attendees

- Attendees can apply the coupon code during checkout
- The discount is applied instantly to the final price
- If the coupon is expired or usage limit is exceeded, it won’t be accepted
- A coupon will be rejected if:
- It has expired.
- It has reached its usage limit.
- It’s entered in the wrong event’s checkout (coupons are event-specific).
- When a coupon is applied:
- The discounted price is shown before checkout.
- The final amount charged reflects the discount.
- The coupon label appear in confirmation emails of attendees.

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Coupons work only when payments are enabled for the event
- 100% discount coupons are not supported
- Coupons are specific to the event type they are created for

This helps you control pricing while still keeping payments and access secure.

## Troubleshooting

- **Coupon not applied?** Confirm payments are enabled and the coupon is created for the correct event type.
- **Discount doesn’t show at checkout?** Double-check the coupon code spelling and expiration date.
- **Coupon already used?** Check the usage limit — it may have been reached.
- **Coupon reduced price less than expected?** Make sure the discount type (percent vs amount) matches your intention.
