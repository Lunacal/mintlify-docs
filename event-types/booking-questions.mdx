| **Field**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mandatory**         | When enabled, attendees must answer this question before completing their booking.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Internal Label**    | A private tag for question (not shown to the booker). Whatever you enter here can also be used in workflows — for example, if the internal label is **Phone_Number**, you can reference it as  to display the attendee’s phone number in your workflow. |
| **Answer Suggestion** | Optional preset text or examples shown inside the input field to attendees on what to enter.                                                                                                                                                            |

When editing the **Name** question, you can use the **Split** option to ask the booker to enter their **first **and **last **name separately.

> **<u>Please don't edit the default booking questions that you see. It might lead to unexpected behaviour. You can turn them off if you don't want to use it.</u>**

**Step 4**

Use the **toggle **to “**Hide/Unhide**” any question, hidden questions aren't going to show on your public booking page to attendee.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Editing **default booking** questions instead of turning them off, which can cause unexpected behavior.
- Forgetting to click “**Save**”, so new fields don’t appear on the booking page.
- Using the wrong question type (e.g., Short text for multi-choice answers), leading to messy data.
- Hiding required info by mistake with “**Hide/Unhide**”, causing gaps in submissions.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Keep “**Name**” (with “split”), “**Email**”, and one qualifier (e.g., “Short text” for goal).
- Use “**Mandatory**” only for must-have fields; keep the form short.
- Prefer “**Dropdown**” or “**Multi Choice**” for standardized answers; use “Long text” sparingly.
- Add a “**Consent Checkbox**”, It's used for consent or agreement confirmations (e.g., “I agree to the terms and conditions”).
