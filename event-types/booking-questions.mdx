**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Editing default booking questions instead of turning them off, which can cause unexpected behavior.
- Forgetting to click “Save”, so new fields don’t appear on the booking page.
- Using the wrong question type (e.g., Short text for multi-choice answers), leading to messy data.
- Hiding required info by mistake with “Hide/Unhide”, causing gaps in submissions.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Keep “Name” (with “split”), “Email”, and one qualifier (e.g., “Short text” for goal).
- Use “Mandatory” only for must-have fields; keep the form short.
- Prefer “Dropdown” or “Multi Choice” for standardized answers; use “Long text” sparingly.
- Add a “Consent Checkbox” if you collect personal data or sync to CRM.
