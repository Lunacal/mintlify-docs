| Attendees see all available time slots normally.                                                   | Each time slot has a fixed maximum capacity set by the organizer.                        | If a cancellation reduces capacity, the slot becomes available again automatically.               |
| For group slots, they see the number of remaining seats (if enabled). Example: **“3 spots left”**. | Every new booking reduces the available seats for that particular time slot.             | Seat count automatically increases by one.                                                        |
| Once a slot is fully booked, the attendee will **no longer see that time slot**.                   | When capacity reaches zero, the slot is marked as full and hidden from the booking page. | If the slot was hidden because it was full, it becomes *visible again* with updated availability. |
| They can only book up to the maximum number of seats allowed per booking (if you set a limit).     | The system prevents bookings beyond the per-slot capacity.                               | The slot instantly reopens without you doing anything manually.                                   |
| If multiple slots have availability, attendees can choose any of them.                             | Capacity is managed individually per time slot, not globally across the event.           | Updated availability is shown in real time to the next attendee.                                  |
