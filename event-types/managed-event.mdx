## What are Managed Events?

Managed Events in **lunacal** allow admins to create and control event types centrally, then assign them to one or more team members (hosts). Instead of each person creating and maintaining their own event types, Managed Events ensure consistency across your team while still allowing hosts to focus only on their availability.

Managed Events are ideal when you want:

- A single source of truth for event settings
- Consistent branding, duration, buffers, and rules
- Easy assignment and reassignment of hosts
- Scalable scheduling for growing teams

## How Managed Events Work

1. An admin creates a Managed Event
2. Event settings are configured and (optionally) locked
3. Members are assigned to the Managed Event
4. lunacal uses the event rules and host availability to schedule meetings

Admins control the event configuration, while members simply receive bookings based on their availability.

## Permissions Tab (Managed Events)

Inside every Managed Event, there is a **Permissions** tab.

This tab allows admins/owners to control what assigned members are allowed to modify within that specific Managed Event.

- If the admin/owner **enables permission** for a setting, the assigned member can modify that setting.
- If the admin/owner **does not enable permission**, the member cannot change that setting.
- Any setting not allowed remains locked and controlled only by the admin/owner.

> This ensures flexibility where needed, while still maintaining centralized control over critical event configurations.

## What Can Be Managed (Locked) by Admins

Admins can decide which event fields are centrally managed and which are editable by hosts.

Commonly managed fields include:

- Event name and description
- Duration
- Location (Zoom, Google Meet, phone, in‑person, etc.)
- Availability rules
- Buffers and minimum notice
- Booking questions
- Confirmation, reminder, and follow‑up emails

Locked fields stay consistent across all assigned hosts.
