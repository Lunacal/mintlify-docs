If you don't know how to create coupons, see the [Creating coupons](https://help.lunacal.ai/event-types/coupons) guide and then return here to set up special minimum-price coupons.

## Overview

Special coupons allow you to apply discounts **only when the booking total meets a minimum price**. This is useful when you want to:

- Prevent coupons from being used on smaller or cheaper packages
- Encourage users to book **more slots** or **higher-value packages**
- Create targeted offers without creating multiple coupons

## Key Concept: Minimum Price

When creating a coupon, you can set a **Minimum Price**.

- The coupon will **only apply if the total booking amount is equal to or greater than this minimum price**.
- If the booking total is **below** the minimum price, the coupon will **not apply**.

## How It Works (With Example)

### Example Setup

- **Price per slot:** \$20
- **Coupon minimum price:** \$50
- **Coupon discount:** 50%

### Booking Scenarios

#### ❌ 2-Slot Booking

- Total price: 2 × \$20 = **\$40**
- Minimum required: **\$50**
- Result: ❌ Coupon **will not apply**

Reason: The total booking value is below the minimum price set for the coupon.

#### ✅ 3-Slot Booking

- Total price: 3 × \$20 = **\$60**
- Minimum required: **\$50**
- Result: ✅ Coupon **will apply**

Discount calculation:

- 50% of \$60 = **\$30 discount**
- Final price: **\$30**

## Why Use Minimum Price Coupons?

Using minimum price–based coupons helps you:

- 🚫 Block discounts on low-value bookings
- 📈 Increase average booking value
- 🎯 Target specific packages or slot counts
- 🧠 Avoid creating separate coupons for each package

## Common Use Cases

- Allow coupons only on **3+ slot bookings**
- Offer discounts on **premium or higher-value packages**
- Run promotions like:
  - “Get 50% off on bookings above \$50”
  - “Special discount for bulk bookings”

## Important Notes

- The minimum price is checked **after slots are selected** and **before the discount is applied**.
- If the total booking amount changes and falls below the minimum price, the coupon will automatically become invalid.
- The coupon discount (percentage or flat) is applied **only when the minimum price condition is satisfied**.

## Summary

By setting a minimum price on coupons, you can control exactly **which booking sizes qualify for discounts**. This ensures coupons are used strategically and only on bookings that meet your business goals.
