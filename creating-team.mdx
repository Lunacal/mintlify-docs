Use “Teams” to group people by department, project, or location and control access in one place. It keeps invites, roles, and membership clear.

**Step 1**

Navigate to the "Teams" section and click "Create a new team".

Example Multiple locations? Create “Clinic – Koramangala” and “Clinic – Indiranagar” so staff and events stay separate.

**Step 3**

Click "Add Team Member". This opens the invite page.

Example Hiring a new SDR batch? Paste all emails together, then set the same role once to save time. 

**Step 5**

To give the same role (for example, all "Members"), enter multiple emails together and choose the role once.

To assign different roles:

Enter an email → Select a role → Click "Send invite"

Repeat for the next email with another role.

Example Keep managers as "Admins" so they can edit team settings; set agents as "Members" to book and manage their events.

**Step 6**

User receives an invitation email.

Example If someone says they can’t see team events, ask them to open "Teams" and click "Accept". That usually fixes it. 

**Step 10**

Your team is ready!

**Common mistakes to avoid**

Sending invites but forgetting role selection, which limits what members can do later.

Members creating accounts but not clicking "Accept" in "Teams", so they remain outside the team.

Mixing departments in one team (sales + support), making permissions and routing harder to manage.
