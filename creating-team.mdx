Use “**Teams**” to group people by department, project, or location and control access in one place. It keeps invites, roles, and membership clear.

## Step 1

Navigate to the "**Teams**" section and click "**Create a new team**".

Enter the name of your team (for example, “**Sales North America**”), then click "**Continue**".

Example Multiple locations? Create “Clinic – Koramangala” and “Clinic – Indiranagar” so staff and events stay separate.

## Step 3

Click "**Add Team Member**". This opens the invite page.

Example Hiring a new SDR batch? Paste all emails together, then set the same role once to save time.

## Step 5

To give the same role (for example, all "**Members**"), enter multiple emails together and choose the role once.

To assign different roles:

Enter an email → Select a role → Click "**Send invite**"

Repeat for the next email with another role.

Example If someone says they can’t see team events, ask them to open "**Teams**" and click "**Accept**". That usually fixes it.

## Step 10

Your team is ready!

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Sending invites but forgetting role selection, which limits what members can do later.
- Members creating accounts but not clicking "**Accept**" in "**Teams**", so they remain outside the team.
- Mixing departments in one team (sales + support), making permissions and routing harder to manage.
