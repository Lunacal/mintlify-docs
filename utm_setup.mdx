## **Step 1 – Open the Event Type**

Start by logging in to your Lunacal dashboard.\
Navigate to the **Event Types** section and choose the event type where you want to track UTM parameters. Click the settings icon (⚙️) or open the event type directly.

## **Step 2 – Go to Booking Questions**

Once inside the event setup, look at the left-hand sidebar.

Click on **Booking questions** to view and manage the questions that appear on the booking form. These questions help you collect custom data manually or through URL params when someone books your event.

## **Step 3 – Add a New Booking Question**

Click on the **Add / Edit booking question** button.

In the popup form:

- **Question:**\
  Enter a user-friendly label like: `UTM Source`

  > This is the label that would normally be shown on the booking form (but we’ll hide it later).
- **Question Type:**\
  Choose `Short Text` from the dropdown. This allows UTM values (like `linkedin`, `newsletter`, `twitter`) to be entered or passed via URL.
- **Mandatory:**\
  Leave this **disabled**, since we’ll be populating it via URL and not asking users to fill it out.
- **Internal Label:**\
  Enter: `utm_source`

  > This label is important — it gets used in the booking URL as the query param key. Always advised to start it with `utm_` to maintain clarity and consistency in your tracking.
- **Answer Suggestion:**\
  (Optional) Add common values you expect like: `linkedin`, `instagram`, `email`.

Click the **Add** button to save the booking question.

## **Step 4 – Hide the Question**

Once the UTM Source question has been added, toggle the switch to **Hide** the field.\
This ensures it doesn’t appear on the public booking form, but it will still be processed if passed through a URL query parameter.

> Hidden questions can still capture values passed via URL, making this ideal for tracking marketing sources without disrupting the booking flow.

## **Step 5 – Generate Your Booking URL with UTM Parameters**

Next, go to your **View Booking Page** for the event.

To pass UTM data, simply append it to the end of your booking URL as query parameters.

For example:

`https://lunacal.ai/{username}/{event-name}?utm_source=linkedin`

> ✅ Make sure the keys in the URL match the **internal labels** you’ve set in your booking questions (e.g. `utm_source`, `utm_campaign`, etc.).

## **Step 6 – Book and Verify**

Book a meeting using the updated booking link with UTM parameters.

After a successful booking:

- As the **event admin**, you can view the UTM value (e.g., `linkedin`) under the booking details in your Lunacal dashboard.
- Additionally, if booking notifications are enabled, the UTM values will appear in your confirmation email.

- Use it to evaluate marketing channels and attribution.

You can extend this setup to include `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, or custom fields in same way\!
