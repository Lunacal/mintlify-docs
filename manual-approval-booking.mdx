When you enable **Manual Booking**, all booking requests for this Event Type will require your approval before they are confirmed.
This gives you full control over who gets approved, ideal for high-value sessions, limited seats, or situations where you want to screen attendees before confirming.

when **Manual Booking** is turned on:
- Client sends a booking request
- The booking stays in Pending state
- You (the host) must **manually Approve** or **Reject** it from email and [bookings section](https://app.lunacal.ai/bookings/upcoming)
- Only after approval the client receives the confirmation email & calendar invite
- This prevents unwanted or spam bookings from being auto-confirmed.

Step 1\
Go to "[Event Types](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types)" in your dashboard.
