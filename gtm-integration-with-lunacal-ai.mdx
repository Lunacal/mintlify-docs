## **1. Understanding GTM Container ID in Lunacal**

A GTM Container ID looks like:`GTM-XXXXXXXX`

lunacal requires this ID to load your GTM container and trigger your tags.\
You can set this ID at multiple levels depending on your tracking needs:

### **(A) Account-level (User Profile)**

- This is the **default container** for your personal events.
- It loads on all booking pages unless overridden by a specific container set for your Event Types.

### **(B) Team-level**

- Each team can have its **own GTM Container ID**.
- When added here, It loads on all team events, it didn't **overrides the account-level ID**.

### Installing GTM

- Go-to: **Integrations** \> [Analytics](https://app.lunacal.ai/apps?tab=apps&category=analytics)

GTM is now installed.

`The GTM ID you enter here becomes the default ID shown inside event types (when you enable GTM for them).`

## 2.  Enabling GTM for Individual Event Types

Installing GTM does **not automatically enable it** for all event types.\
You must activate GTM for each event type you want to track.

- Go to [Event Types](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types)
- Click the gear ⚙️ icon.
- Click **Edit**.

![step4](https://lunacalwebsite.blob.core.windows.net/website-assets/HelpDocs/4.webp)

- Go to **Integrations** Section.
- You will see a GTM toggle in **off** state.
- To Enable GTM Turn **ON** the GTM toggle

![step 5](https://lunacalwebsite.blob.core.windows.net/website-assets/HelpDocs/5.webp)

`You will see the same GTM ID you entered during installation (auto-filled)`

Click **SAVE**

That's it — GTM is now active for this event type.

You can repeat these same steps for your team events.

## 3.  Datalayer Events Triggered by Lunacal

When GTM is enabled for an event type, Lunacal automatically fires three datalayer events on booking interactions:

1. `booking_created`

- Triggered when a booking is successfully created.

2. `booking_cancelled`

- Triggered when a booking is cancelled by the user or team.

3. `booking_rescheduled`

- Triggered when a booking is rescheduled to a new time.

These events are sent to your GTM container and can be used to trigger tags, pixels, and analytics tracking.
