## **1. Understanding GTM Container ID in Lunacal**

A GTM Container ID looks like:`GTM-XXXXXXXX`

lunacal requires this ID to load your GTM container and trigger your tags.\
You can set this ID at multiple levels depending on your tracking needs:

### **(A) Account-level (User Profile)**

- This is the **default container** for your personal events.
- It loads on all booking pages unless overridden by a specific container set for your Event Types.

### **(B) Team-level**

- Each team can have its **own GTM Container ID**.
- When added here, It loads on all team events, it didn't **overrides the account-level ID**.

### Installing GTM

- Go-to: **Integrations** \> [Analytics](https://app.lunacal.ai/apps?tab=apps&category=analytics)
- Find **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**.
- Click **Connect**.

## Step 2: Choose Installation Scope

When you click **Connect**, you will see:

**Option A – Connect GTM for your Account**

- This makes GTM available for all event types in your workspace.

**Option B – Connect GTM for a specific Team**

- Choose this if you only want GTM for selected teams. Select your preferred option and continue.

## Step 3: Enter Your GTM Container ID

- After selecting Account or Team, you will see an input box.
- Enter your GTM container ID (example: GTM-XXXXX123).
- Click Save.

GTM is now installed.

`The GTM ID you enter here becomes the default ID shown inside event types (when you enable GTM for them).`

## 2.  Enabling GTM for Individual Event Types

Installing GTM does **not automatically enable it** for all event types.\
You must activate GTM for each event type you want to track.

- Go to [Event Types](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types)
- Find the event type.
- Click the gear ⚙️ icon.
- Click Edit.
- Go to Integrations Section.
- You will see a GTM toggle in off state.
- To Enable GTM Turn ON the GTM toggle

`You will see the same GTM ID you entered during installation (auto-filled)`

Click **SAVE**

That's it — GTM is now active for this event type.

You can repeat these same steps for your team events.
