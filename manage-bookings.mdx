## Step 1

Click “**Bookings**” in the left menu. The page shows client names and event details grouped under “**Upcoming**”, “**Unconfirmed**”, “**Past**”, and “**Canceled**”.

## Step 2

Use the “**Edit**” drop-down on any meeting to **cancel**, **reschedule**, **request a reschedule**, or change the “**Location**”. **Example**: A client asks to meet 30 minutes later—choose “**Reschedule**”, pick a new time, and send the update.

## Step 3

To change where the meeting happens, select a new “**Location**” (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Phone, Office) and save. **Example**: You switch from in-person to Zoom because you’re traveling—set “Location” to Zoom so the link is included.

## Step 4

Click a specific booking to see full details: **event name, date and time, attendees**, and “**Location**”. **Example**: Before the call, open the booking to copy the meet link and confirm the attendee’s email.

## Step 5

“**Unconfirmed**” shows bookings that haven’t been finalized yet—this includes cases where payment is pending. Example: Someone started booking a paid session but didn’t complete the payment—follow up or resend the link.

## Step 6

“**Past**” lists meetings that already happened so you can review what’s done or add notes to your CRM.

## Step 7

“**Canceled**” lists meetings that were called off; use it to confirm no-show trends or to restore context if a client rebooks later.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Editing a calendar entry directly instead of using “**Edit**” on the “**Bookings**” page, which can cause mismatched invites.
- Forgetting to update “**Location**” after switching from in-person to online, leading to missing links.
- Ignoring “**Unconfirmed**”, so pending payments or partial bookings go unnoticed.
- Rescheduling without sending the update, leaving attendees on the old time.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Review “**Unconfirmed**” once daily to clear pending items.
- Prefer “**Request a reschedule**” over canceling when timing slips by less than a day.
- Standardize “**Location**” (**e.g**., Zoom for all first calls) to reduce errors.
- Check “**Canceled**” weekly to spot patterns and improve show rates.
