## Step 1

Click “Bookings” in the left menu. The page shows client names and event details grouped under “Upcoming”, “Unconfirmed”, “Past”, and “Canceled”.

## Step 2

Use the “Edit” drop-down on any meeting to cancel, reschedule, request a reschedule, or change the “Location”. Example: A client asks to meet 30 minutes later—choose “Reschedule”, pick a new time, and send the update.

## Step 3

To change where the meeting happens, select a new “Location” (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Phone, Office) and save. Example: You switch from in-person to Zoom because you’re traveling—set “Location” to Zoom so the link is included.

## Step 4

Click a specific booking to see full details: event name, date and time, attendees, and “Location”. Example: Before the call, open the booking to copy the meet link and confirm the attendee’s email.

## Step 5

“Unconfirmed” shows bookings that haven’t been finalized yet—this includes cases where payment is pending. Example: Someone started booking a paid session but didn’t complete the payment—follow up or resend the link.

## Step 6

“Past” lists meetings that already happened so you can review what’s done or add notes to your CRM.

## Step 7

“Canceled” lists meetings that were called off; use it to confirm no-show trends or to restore context if a client rebooks later.
