# Event Booking Configuration

> This document provides a comprehensive guide to configuring limits and buffer settings for event bookings. By following these steps, users can effectively manage scheduling parameters, ensuring adequate preparation and transition times between meetings, as well as controlling the frequency and future scope of bookings.

## Step 1

To configure limit and buffer settings, start by selecting your specific event type.

## Step 3

Within the buffer settings, you can add a booking notice, limit booking frequencies, and set restrictions on future bookings. Under buffer settings, you can specify a buffer before and after a meeting. Adding a buffer before a meeting provides preparation time before the event begins, ensuring readiness. For instance, a 10-minute buffer allows time to review notes, grab a coffee, or complete any last-minute tasks.

## Step 4

The buffer after a meeting allows for transition time between calls, preventing back-to-back scheduling. For example, you might set a 15 or 30-minute buffer to reset, make notes, or take a break.

## Step 5

In the advance booking notice section, you can define the lead time required before bookings can be made.

## Step 11

For example, a user might only be able to view available bookings for the next 30 days. Simply configure this in the limit future bookings section. Once all settings are in place, click the "Save" button to apply your limits and buffer settings.
