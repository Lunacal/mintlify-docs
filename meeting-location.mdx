**Different types of meeting locations available in Lunacal are:**

- **Google Meet** - Automatically integrates Google Meet for virtual meetings.
- **Zoom Video** – Automatically integrates Zoom for virtual meetings.
- **MS Teams** – Automatically integrates Microsoft Teams for virtual meetings.
- **FaceTime** – Automatically integrates FaceTime for virtual meetings.
- **Guest Address** – Collect the guest's location for in-person services.
- **Organizer Address** – Show your address so attendees know where to meet you.
- **Guest Phone Number** – Collect the guest's phone number during booking.
- **Organizer Phone Number** – Share your number with attendees after booking.
- **Link Meeting** - Allows you to add a custom online meeting link for any meeting platform or URL.
  1. For **Link Meeting**, you can add a **Custom Label** so instead of showing the raw URL, it shows a clean name like **_Join Meeting_**.
  2. When "**Display on booking page**" is on, **Custom Label** will not work.

For both **Organizer's Address** and **Custom Link Meeting**, you will see an option:

<h3>☑ Display on booking page</h3>

When this option is enabled, the meeting location (your address / your custom meeting link) will be **shown directly on the booking page before the attendee confirms the meeting**.

| Section                           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What this means for attendees** | • They can see the location **before booking**.• Lets them decide if the meeting format (in-person, link, office, etc.) works for them.• Provides full transparency about where the meeting will happen.        |
| **When you should enable it**     | • When you want guests to know the address **before confirming** (e.g., office visits).• When using a **Custom Link** (Google Meet, Teams, personal link) and want attendees to verify the platform in advance. |
| **When you should NOT enable it** | • When the address/link should only be shared **after booking** for privacy or security.• When only confirmed attendees should see the location (via email/calendar invite).                                    |

<h2>Step 5</h2>

<h2>Step 10</h2>

"**Organizer Address**" - You can set your own address, which will be shown on the booking page so attendees know exactly where to meet you. ⚠️ Warning: Organizer Address Will be visible on the booking page. Enable only if you're okay sharing your location publicly.

<h2>Step 11</h2>

"**Guest Phone Number**" - The system collects the guest's phone number at the time of booking, which you can use to connect directly.

<h2>Step 12</h2>

"**Organizer Phone Number**" - Your phone number will be shared with attendees after booking the slot, so they can reach you if needed.

<h2>Add Another Location</h2>

You can add **multiple meeting location** types to the same event — for example Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or any other location option.

When you add 2 or more locations, the attendee will see all available options on the booking page, each with a checkbox or selection option. They can then choose the meeting location they prefer before confirming the booking.
