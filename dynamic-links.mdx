description: "Use “Using Dynamic Links” to find a common time across time zones without back-and-forth. On “Dynamic Bookings” pages, you can combine teammates’ schedules by adding their usernames to one link."
mode: "wide"

## Step 1

Open one teammate’s scheduling link. Append the other teammates’ usernames with a plus sign, then press Enter to view shared availability (e.g., …/millie+carter+john).\
Example: Your team sits in New York, London, and Bengaluru. Add +london_teammate and +blr_teammate to Millie’s link to see only slots that work for everyone.

## Step 3

Pick a time (e.g., 8 August, 11:00). Enter your name in the field.\
Example: If you’re booking for a client, type the client’s name here so the event shows the right attendee.

## Step 5

You’ll see a confirmation screen—your booking is complete.\
Example: Need to align three teammates and an external partner? Add only your two teammates’ usernames; share the confirmed time with the partner afterward.
