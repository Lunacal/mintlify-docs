title: "Using Dynamic Links"
description: "Use “Using Dynamic Links” to find a common time across time zones without back-and-forth. On “Dynamic Bookings” pages, you can combine teammates’ schedules by adding their usernames to one link."
mode: "wide"

## Step 1

Open one teammate’s scheduling link. Append the other teammates’ username with a plus sign, then press Enter to view shared availability (e.g., …/millie+carter+john). Example: Your team sits in New York, London, and Bengaluru. Add +london_teammate and +blr_teammate to Millie’s link to see only slots that work for everyone.

## Step 2

Review the combined availability shown on the page. Pick a slot that fits all the selected teammates.
Example: If mornings are busy for London, scan for early afternoon IST which overlaps late morning UK and early morning ET.

## Step 3

Pick a time (e.g., 8 August, 11:00). Enter your name in the field.
Example: If you’re booking for a client, type the client’s name here so the event shows the right attendee.

## Step 4

Enter your email address and hit confirm.
Example: Use your work email so calendar invites land on your primary calendar.

## Step 5

You’ll see a confirmation screen—your booking is complete.
Example: Need to align three teammates and an external partner? Add only your two teammates’ usernames; share the confirmed time with the partner afterward.

**Common mistakes to avoid**
• Typing @ or spaces instead of + between usernames (use + only).
• Mixing display names with usernames; dynamic links require exact usernames.
• Adding people who don’t have any working hours set, which can hide all slots.
• Forgetting to press Enter after editing the URL, so the page doesn’t refresh.

**Good defaults to start with
**• Start with 2 usernames (+teammate1+teammate2) to keep availability broad; add more only if needed.
• Prefer 30–45 minute slots when aligning 3+ people; they’re easier to match.
• Book within the next 7–14 days to maximize overlap and reduce reschedules.
