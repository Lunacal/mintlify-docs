## Step 2

Choose where to install PayPal: a specific event or your teams.\
Example: You run free intro calls but paid workshops. Install PayPal only on the “Workshop” event so intro calls stay free.

## Step 3

Enter your “Client ID” and “Secret Key”, then click “Save”.\
Example: If your developer manages credentials, ask them for the “Client ID” and “Secret Key” from PayPal. Keep the “Secret Key” private
**Note**: To Get Your PayPal Client ID and Secret Key refer to these [Docs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/) OR [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/povhVRdCExc)

## Step 6

Set a price (e.g., \$10) and select the currency.\
Example: If your audience is global, set USD. If most clients are in the EU, pick EUR to reduce conversion fees.

## Step 8

Your setup is complete. You’ll see a \$10 tag on that event type.\
Example: A client books the “Workshop” and sees the price on the scheduling page—no surprises, fewer drop-offs
