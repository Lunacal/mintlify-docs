## Step 2

Choose where to install PayPal: a specific event or your teams.\
Example: You run free intro calls but paid workshops. Install PayPal only on the “Workshop” event so intro calls stay free.

## Step 3

Enter your “**Client ID**” and “**Secret Key**”, then click “**Save**”.\
Example: If your developer manages credentials, ask them for the “**Client ID**” and “**Secret Key**” from PayPal. Keep the “**Secret Key**” private **Note**: To Get Your PayPal Client ID and Secret Key refer to these [Docs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/) OR [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/povhVRdCExc)

## Step 6

Set a price (e.g., \$5) and select the currency.\
Example: If your audience is global, set USD. If most clients are in the EU, pick EUR to reduce conversion fees.

## Step 8

Your setup is complete. You’ll see a price tag on that event type.\
Example: A client books the “Workshop” and sees the price on the scheduling page—no surprises, fewer drop-offs

**Common mistakes to avoid -**

- Entering the wrong “Client ID”“Secret Key” (typos break checkout).
- Forgetting to enable the “paypal” toggle under “integrations” for the event.
- Setting price but not saving; the event remains free.
- Installing PayPal at team level when you meant to apply it only to one event.

**Good defaults to start with -**

- Install PayPal on one paid event first (keep trial/intro events free).
- Use a single common currency for your main audience.
- Start with a round price (for example, \$25) to simplify checkout and reporting.
- Test one real booking end-to-end before promoting the link.
