Team members allow you to collaborate within a company by sharing scheduling pages, events, and availability.
> **Note:** You must be the team owner or have admin permissions to invite or remove members.

## Step 1

## Step 8
Important: After creating their account, the user must go to the **Teams** section and click **“Accept”** to officially join the team.

> 1. Once accepted, the member will have access to the team’s events, scheduling pages, and settings based on their role.
> 2. If a user hasn’t accepted the invite yet, they will appear as a pending member in the team settings.
