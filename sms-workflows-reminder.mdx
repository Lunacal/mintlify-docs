# SMS Pricing

Lunacal SMS costs are determined by the **length of the final message** and the **destination country/carrier**.

## How Message Length Affects Cost

The actual SMS length can vary depending on details like attendee names, organizer names, or event titles.

Example messages:

- Short message:  
> "Hi Alex, your event Demo with Jordan has been scheduled for 25 Oct at 10:00 AM (IST)."  
  This message may fit within one segment.

- Long message:  
> "Hi Alexandra Thompson, your event Quarterly Performance Review with Jonathan Williams has been scheduled for 25 Oct at 10:00 AM (IST)."  
  This message may exceed the segment limit and require multiple segments.

The longer the final message, the more segments it uses, and the higher the cost.

## SMS Length and Segment Cost

SMS messages are billed using a **segment-based system**. Each segment has a character limit:

| Type | Characters per Segment | Example |
|------|-----------------------|---------|
| Standard SMS | 70 characters = 1 segment | A 70-character message = 1 segment |
| Multi-part SMS | Based on number of segments. For example, a 134-character message = 134 ÷ 70 ≈ 1.9, rounded up to 2 segments | 134 characters → 2 segments |
| Unicode / Multi-part | English: 1 segment = 70 characters, 2 segments = 134 characters, etc. | Longer Unicode messages may require multiple segments |
| Unicode / Other languages | 1 segment = 70 characters, 2 segments = 134 characters, etc. | Same rules apply as English Unicode |

> Messages with emojis or non-English characters may reduce the number of characters per segment, resulting in more segments.


## Pricing

Each country and carrier has its own **price per segment**. Lunacal calculates the total number of segments required for each message and applies the corresponding rate.

You can view the current **price per segment** for each country/carrier in the table below:
