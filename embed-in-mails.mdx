## Step 3

Select the date(s) and time slots you want to share (e.g., 12th at 9:00, 09:30, 10:00), then click “Copy”.\
Example: A consultant shares three morning slots for quick discovery calls so clients can choose without back-and-forth.

## Step 4

Paste the copied slots into your email body where you want them to appear.\
Example: A recruiter pastes two days of options near the top of the email so candidates see them immediately.

## Step 5

Recipients click a time slot in the email to select their preference.\
Example: A support lead drops slots into a follow-up email—users click once and skip manual coordination.

## Step 6

After clicking a slot, recipients enter their name and email, then click “Confirm” to finalize the booking.\
Example: An agency sends options to a new lead; once they hit “Confirm,” the calendar invite is created automatically.
