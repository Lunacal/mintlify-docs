## Step 3

Select the date(s) and time slots you want to share (e.g., 12th at 9:00, 09:30, 10:00), then click “**Copy**”.\
**Example**: A consultant shares three morning slots for quick discovery calls so clients can choose without back-and-forth.

## Step 4

Paste the copied slots into your email body where you want them to appear.\
**Example**: A recruiter pastes two days of options near the top of the email so candidates see them immediately.

## Step 5

Recipients click a time slot in the email to select their preference.\
**Example**: A support lead drops slots into a follow-up email—users click once and skip manual coordination.

## Step 6

After clicking a slot, recipients enter their name and email, then click “**Confirm**” to finalize the booking.\
**Example**: An agency sends options to a new lead; once they hit “Confirm,” the calendar invite is created automatically.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Pasting into a plain-text email (links may break). Use a rich-text editor or your email tool’s default compose window.
- Sharing too many slots across many days, which overwhelms the reader. Keep choices focused.
- Reusing old slot blocks after you change availability; always generate fresh slots from “Add to Email”.
- Mixing different event types in one email, which confuses recipients about duration and details.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Offer 3–5 slots across 1–2 days to keep decisions simple.
- Place the slot block high in the email so it’s visible without scrolling.
- If most clients prefer mornings, share slots in your best-responding hours first.
- Test by sending the email to yourself once to confirm links and formatting.
