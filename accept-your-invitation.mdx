## 1. Accept Your Invitation

Once an team owner/admin adds you to a lunacal workspace:

1. Check your email for an **invitation from lunacal.ai**
2. Click **Accept Invitation**
3. You’ll be asked to:
   - Sign up for a new lunacal account, or
   - Log in to an existing account

After Onboarding, you have to go to [teams section](https://app.lunacal.ai/teams)

## 2. Complete Your Profile

Your profile information helps attendees know who they’re booking with.

Go to [**Profile Settings**](https://app.lunacal.ai/new-settings?tabName=general) and update:

- Full name
- Profile photo
- Role or designation
- Time zone (auto-detected, but editable)

This information appears on your booking page and confirmation emails.

## 3. Connect Your Calendar

To avoid double bookings, Lunacal needs access to your calendar.

1. Navigate to \*\*Integrations → \*\*[**Calendar**](https://app.lunacal.ai/apps?category=calendar)
2. Connect your preferred calendar:
   - Google Calendar
   - Outlook / Microsoft Calendar
3. Choose:
   - Which calendars Lunacal should **check for conflicts**
   - Which calendar new bookings should be **added to**

Only your availability is shared — your private events remain hidden.

## 4. Set Your Availability

Availability controls when others can book meetings with you.

1. Go to [**Availability Settings**](https://app.lunacal.ai/new-settings?tabName=availability)
2. Define:
   - Working days
   - Working hours
   - Breaks or buffer times
3. Save your availability

## 5. Create or Manage Event Types

Event types define what kind of meetings people can book.

Go to **Event Types** and:

- Create a new event, or
- Edit an existing one assigned by your owner/admin

You can configure:

- Event duration
- Meeting location (Zoom, Google Meet, phone, in-person, etc.)
- Slot limits
- Booking rules (advance notice, buffers)

## 6. Share Your Booking Link

Once your event type is ready, share your booking link.

You can use it in:

- Email signatures
- WhatsApp or Slack
- Social media
- Website buttons

Example:

```
https://lunacal.ai/your-username/meeting-name
```

For team or round-robin bookings, owner may provide shared booking links.

## 7. Notifications & Reminders

lunacal automatically sends:

- Booking confirmations
- Cancellation emails
- Reminder notifications

Depending on your organization:

- Workflows may already be set by owner, or
- You can customize reminders in **Workflow Settings**

## 8. Manage Your Bookings

From your dashboard, you can:

- View upcoming meetings
- See past bookings
- Cancel or reschedule events
- Track attendee details

All updates sync automatically with your connected calendar.
