## Overview

lunacal allows you to accept payments using **Stripe** for paid events and bookings.\
The Stripe setup flow is almost identical to [**PayPal**](https://help.lunacal.ai/paypal-integration) — the only difference is selecting **Stripe** as the payment method and entering your Stripe credentials.

Once connected, attendees can pay securely using Stripe during booking.

## Step 1

- Go to [**Integrations**](https://app.lunacal.ai/apps) → “[**Payment**](https://app.lunacal.ai/apps?category=payment)”, then click “**connect**” to start Stripe setup.

## Step 2

- Choose where to install **Stripe** : a specific **event** or your **teams**.\
  **Example**: You run free intro calls but paid workshops. Install Stripe only on the “**Workshop**” event so intro calls stay free.

## Step 3

- Enter your **Stripe credentials**

## 3. Choose Where Stripe Applies

You can choose Stripe to **specific events only**

This is useful if you want some events to remain **free**.

## 4. Enable Stripe for an Event

1. Open the event you want to charge for
2. Go to the **Payments** section
3. Enable the **payment toggle**
4. select stripe as payment method.
5. Set:
   - Event price
   - Currency
6. **Save** the event

## 5. Confirm Your Setup

Once enabled:

- Your booking page will display the **price**
- Attendees will be asked to **pay via Stripe** before confirming the booking

Stripe payments are processed securely and funds are sent directly to your Stripe account.

## Common Issues & Tips

- Make sure you selected **Stripe** (not PayPal) in the payment dropdown
- Double-check your Stripe keys if payments fail
- Don’t forget to **enable Stripe inside the event**, even after connecting it
- Test the flow by making a **test booking** before sharing the link

## What’s Next?

After setting up Stripe, you can:

- Combine Stripe with **coupons**
- Use it with **package bookings**
- Enable payments for **team or individual events**
