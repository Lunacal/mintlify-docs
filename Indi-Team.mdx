## Individual Events
**What they are:**  
- Events created under your personal Lunacal profile.  
- These events are tied only to you, your calendar, and your availability.

**Use cases:**  
- 1:1 calls like *Intro Call, Demo, Consultation*.  
- Personal services (e.g., private tutoring, coaching, mentoring).  
- Freelancers who want to share their own booking link.  

**Example:**  
- Your personal profile link:  
  `lunacal.ai/prince-bhatt-pfz`  

- An individual event booking page:  
  `lunacal.ai/prince-bhatt-pfz/consulting`  

When invitees open this link, they only see *your availability and details*.

## Team Events

**What they are:**  
- Events created within a team (e.g., your company or client’s company).  
- Managed under the "Teams" section.  
- Can involve multiple team members with special scheduling rules.

**Types of Team Events:**  
1. **[Collective Scheduling](https://help.lunacal.ai/collective-shedule)** → The event is booked only when *all selected members* are available.  
2. **[Round Robin Scheduling](https://help.lunacal.ai/Round-Robin)** → New bookings are automatically assigned to the *next available member*.
