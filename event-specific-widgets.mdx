## Overview

By default, all widgets (Gallery, Videos, About, Testimonials, Documents, etc.) are shown across **every event type**.

If you have multiple events, they all share the same widget layout.

Event-Specific Widgets allow you to decide:

> Which widget appears on which event.

## Where to Find It

1. Open your **Edit Booking Page Editor**
2. Click **Settings** in the top navigation bar
3. You’ll see:
   - **Show Widgets**
   - **Allow Event-Specific Widgets**

## Setting 1: Show Widgets (Global Toggle)

This controls widgets for the entire booking page.

- **Enabled** → All added widgets are visible
- **Disabled** → No widgets appear on any event and your calendar will be center alligned.

This is the master visibility switch.

## Setting 2: Allow Event-Specific Widgets

When disabled (default):

- Every event type shows the same widgets.

When enabled:

- An **eye icon** appears on each widget.
- You can control visibility per event type.

## How It Works

After enabling **Allow Event-Specific Widgets**:

1. Go to your widgets list.
2. Click the 👁 icon on a widget.
3. Select the event types where it should appear.
4. Save.

That widget will now appear only on selected events.

## Example

You have 4 events:

- 1:1 Consultation
- Webinar
- Portfolio Review
- Corporate Demo

You can configure:

- Consultation → About + Testimonials
- Webinar → Videos + Documents
- Portfolio Review → Gallery only
- Corporate Demo → About + Documents

Each event now has a tailored booking experience.

## When to Use This

Use Event-Specific Widgets if:

- You run different types of events
- Each event needs different supporting content
- You want cleaner, more focused booking pages
- You want higher conversion through relevance
