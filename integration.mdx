## Step 2

Explore categories: “Conferencing”, “Calendar”, “Automation”, “CRM”, “Messaging”, and “Payment”. Click “Conferencing” to view options.\
Example: You host client demos on Zoom—open “Conferencing” to connect Zoom so links are auto-added to meetings.

In “Conferencing”, you’ll find FaceTime, Google Meet, MS Teams, and Zoom Video.

## Step 4

In “Calendar”, available calendars include Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, and Outlook Calendar.\
Example: If your main schedule lives in Google Calendar, connect it so Lunacal avoids double-booking.

## Step 7

In “Messaging”, WhatsApp is available.\
Example: Send a quick WhatsApp confirmation for high-no-show meetings to reduce last-minute drop-offs.

## Step 9

To remove any application, go to “Installed Apps”, click the 3 dotes, then click “Disconnect” to uninstall.\
Example: During testing, disconnect a sandbox Zoom app from “Installed Apps” so only your live Zoom stays connected.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Connecting the wrong account (personal instead of work) under “Calendar” or “Conferencing”, which breaks availability or links.
- Skipping required permissions during connect, leading to missing conference links or failed calendar sync.
- Expecting double-booking protection without connecting your primary “Calendar”.
- Removing an app only from the provider’s site and not clicking “Disconnect” in “Installed Apps”.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Connect your main “Calendar” first; then add one preferred “Conferencing” app.
- If you use a CRM, connect “HubSpot CRM” or “Pipedrive CRM” early so new meetings flow into your pipeline.
- Add “Zapier” later for automations once basic scheduling works.
- Keep only one active app per category to reduce conflicts.
