If you see time slots marked as unavailable on your booking page even though you think you’re free, it’s usually because Lunacal is protecting you from double-bookings or availability rules you’ve configured. This guide helps you identify the most common causes and how to fix them.

## Step 1

"**Calendar Conflicts**" - If one of your connected calendars already has a booking at that time, lunacal will automatically block that slot to avoid double-booking.

> A “calendar conflict” means lunacal detected an existing event in one of your connected calendars during that time — so it blocks that slot on your booking page to prevent overlapping bookings.

Learn how to connect or manage your calendars in the “[Adding Calendars to Lunacal](https://help.lunacal.ai/adding-calendars)” help doc.

lunacal checks availability across all calendars you’ve connected (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.). Even if one calendar shows free, a conflicting event in another calendar can block the slot.

How to find ? Go to Settings → Calendar → Calendars and review all synced calendars.

## Step 2

"**Booking Limits**" - Check if you’ve set any daily, weekly, or per-event booking limits. These limits can restrict availability even if your calendar is technically open.

> Booking limits include things like “maximum bookings per day” or “Advance Bookin Limit” rules. Even if the time is free on your calendar, booking limits may prevent a slot from showing.

How to find ? Go to [**Event Types**](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types) → Select your event → **Booking Limits**.

## Step 3

" Time Interval Between Slots"- Adjust the setting (e.g., 30 minutes).

This setting decides the spacing between slots. A larger interval may make it look like more unavailable time than you expect — even though it’s intentional to give you a buffer.

How to find ? Go to "Event Types" → Select your event → Advanced → Time interval between slots. Note: This only changes the gap between slots, not the actual event duration.

## Step 4

"**Availability & Exceptions**"- Make sure your weekly availability is set correctly and that no exceptions (like holidays or custom rules) are blocking your time.

> Availability Exceptions include days off, holidays, or custom rules that block specific dates/times even if your weekly schedule looks open.

## Quick troubleshooting

- **Double-booked calendar event:** Check all connected calendars for hidden or recurring events.
- **Booking limits seem off:** Review your event’s booking limits and notice settings.
- **Availability looks wrong:** Check weekly availability and exceptions like holidays.
- **Calendar permissions:** Make sure calendars are fully synced and permissions are granted.
