If you see time slots marked as unavailable on your booking page even though you think you’re free, it’s usually because Lunacal is protecting you from double-bookings or availability rules you’ve configured. This guide helps you identify the most common causes and how to fix them.

## Step 1

"Calendar Conflicts" - If one of your connected calendars already has a booking at that time, lunacal will automatically block that slot to avoid double-booking.

How to find ? Go to Settings → Calendar → Calendars and review all synced calendars.

## Step 2

"**Booking Limits**" - Check if you’ve set any daily, weekly, or per-event booking limits. These limits can restrict availability even if your calendar is technically open.

How to find ? Go to [**Event Types**](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types) → Select your event → **Booking Limits**.

## Step 3

" Time Interval Between Slots"- Adjust the setting (e.g., 30 minutes).

How to find ? Go to "Event Types" → Select your event → Advanced → Time interval between slots. Note: This only changes the gap between slots, not the actual event duration.

## Step 4

"**Availability & Exceptions**"- Make sure your weekly availability is set correctly and that no exceptions (like holidays or custom rules) are blocking your time.
