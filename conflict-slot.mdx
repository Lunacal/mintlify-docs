Step 1  
Calendar Conflicts
Go to Settings → Calendar → Calendars and review all synced calendars.  
If one of your connected calendars already has a booking at that time, Lunacal will automatically block that slot to avoid double-booking.

Step 2  
Booking Limits 
Go to Event Types → Select your event → Booking Limits. 
Check if you’ve set any daily, weekly, or per-event booking limits. These limits can restrict availability even if your calendar is technically open.

Step 3  
Time Interval Between Slots 
Go to "Event Types" → Select your event → Advanced → Time interval between slots.**  
Adjust the setting (e.g., 30 minutes).

Note: This only changes the gap between slots, not the actual event duration.  

Step 4  
Availability & Exceptions 
Go to Event Types → Select your event → Availability. 
Make sure your weekly availability is set correctly and that no exceptions (like holidays or custom rules) are blocking your time.
