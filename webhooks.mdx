description: "Webhooks can let your integrations take an action in response to events that occur on Lunacal.ai. This document will guide you through adding webhooks."

## **Step 1**

Start by opening the event type you want to configure.

## **Step 2**

Proceed by clicking on the “Webhooks” option and click on button to add “New Webhook”.

## **Step 3**

You can create webhooks to subscribe to specific events on Lunacal. The **Subscriber URL** should point to your API endpoint that will receive HTTP requests from our platform. Currently, there are three event triggers available:

1. **Booking Canceled** **:** Triggered when a booking is canceled
2. **Booking Created** **:**  Triggered when a new booking is created by any user.
3. **Booking Rescheduled :**  Triggered when an existing booking is rescheduled for future.

## **Step 4**

You can test your webhook using the **Ping Test** button. This will send sample data to your webhook endpoint to verify that it’s functioning properly. If everything is set up correctly, you will receive a `200 OK` response with the following payload:

```
{ "ok": true, "status": 200, "message": "Webhook received" }
```

## Example

Here is a simple example of a server that receives HTTP webhook requests.

<CodeGroup>

```go golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

func webhookHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	switch r.Method {
	case http.MethodGet:
		fmt.Println("Received GET request")
		for k, v := range r.URL.Query() {
			fmt.Printf("%s = %s\n", k, v)
		}
	case http.MethodPost:
		body, _ := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
		defer r.Body.Close()
		fmt.Println("Received POST request")
		fmt.Println("Body:", string(body))
	default:
		http.Error(w, "Method not allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)
		return
	}

	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", webhookHandler)
	fmt.Println("Listening on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```


```javascript javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received GET request');
  console.log(req.query);
  res.status(200).send({ ok: true, status: 200, message: 'Webhook received' });
});

app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received POST request');
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).send({ ok: true, status: 200, message: 'Webhook received' });
});

app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Listening on http://localhost:8080');
});
```
