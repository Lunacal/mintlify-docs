## Individual Events

**What they are:**

- Events created under your personal Lunacal profile.
- These events are tied only to you, your calendar, and your availability.

**Use cases:**

- 1:1 calls like _Intro Call, Demo, Consultation_.
- Personal services (e.g., private tutoring, coaching, mentoring).
- Freelancers who want to share their own booking link.

**Example:**

- Your personal profile link:\
  `lunacal.ai/prince-bhatt-pfz`
- An individual event booking page:\
  `lunacal.ai/prince-bhatt-pfz/consulting`

When invitees open this link, they only see _your availability and details_.

- Managed under the "**Teams**" section.
- Can involve multiple team members with special scheduling rules.

**Types of Team Events:**

1. [**Collective Scheduling**](https://help.lunacal.ai/collective-schedule) → The event is booked only when _all selected members_ are available.
2. [**Round Robin Scheduling**](https://help.lunacal.ai/round-robin-scheduling) → New bookings are automatically assigned to the _next available member_.
