## Overview

Lunacal lets you control language at two different levels:

1. **Visitor Language** – the language your guests see on your booking pages and emails.
2. **App Interface Language** – the language used inside your Lunacal dashboard (admin view).

This ensures a smooth experience for both you and your attendees, especially if you work with an international audience.

You can find these settings at:

[Settings -\> General](https://app.lunacal.ai/new-settings?tabName=general)

## Visitor Language (visible to your guests)

The **Visitor Language** controls the language shown to your attendees across all customer-facing surfaces.

### Where it applies

- Changes apply to new bookings immediately after saving.
