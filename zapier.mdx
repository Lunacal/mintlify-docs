## ⚙️ Step 4: Build Your Zap Workflow

### 4.1 Set up the Trigger

1. Click **\+ Create Zap** in Zapier.
2. In the **Trigger** step, search and select `Lunacal.ai`.
3. Currently, there are three event triggers available:
   - **Booking Cancelled** **:** Triggered when a booking is cancelled
   - **Booking Created** **:**  Triggered when a new booking is created by any user.
   - **Booking Rescheduled :**  Triggered when an existing booking is rescheduled for future.
4. Under **Event**, choose `Booking Created`.
5. Choose the Lunacal account you just connected.
6. Click **Test Trigger** to ensure data is received correctly.
   - This helps Zapier fetch a sample payload for configuration.
   - Make sure you have at least one booking in Lunacal to test with

### 4.2 Set up the Action with Google Sheets [ or any app of your choice ] 

Now we’ll write this booking data to a Google Sheet.

1. In the **Action** step, search for and select `Google Sheets`.
2. Choose the action event: **Create Spreadsheet Row**.
3. Connect your Google account if you haven’t already.
4. Select the spreadsheet and worksheet where the data should go.
5. Ensure the sheet has the following columns created beforehand:
   - `Name`
   - `Email`

> **Note:** You can add more fields like `createdAt`, `Event Name`, etc. These must exist in the sheet before proceeding.

| Email               | `1. Responses Email Value` |
