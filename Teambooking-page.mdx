Click "Edit Team Booking" Page from the top-right corner. This opens your team page editor with all sections in one place.

## Step 2

### Book a Member Directly

This section displays all team members you’ve added. Visitors can click an individual member to book directly with them. You can hide any member by clicking the eye icon (visibility toggle) on their profile card.

Example

Clinic workflow: If you want patients to choose a specific doctor first (e.g., Dr. Alex), show members here and hide most services under "Our Services" so booking goes straight to the doctor’s page.

## Step 3

### Our Services

This block shows all event types created for the team. Visitors can click any event to book it directly. You can hide any event by clicking the eye icon (visibility toggle) on the event card.

**Example**

Services flow: If you want visitors to pick a service (e.g., “Heart Checkup”) and assign a doctor later, show services here and hide most members in "Book a Member Directly"

## **Step 4**

### Widgets & Customization-

Add extra widgets like "About Me", Video Embed, FAQs, or "Why Us?" to personalize the page. Use short, clear content that helps the visitor decide quickly.

**Example**

- Healthcare: Add a brief “About the Clinic”, accepted insurance info in FAQs, and a short intro to build trust before booking.

## Step 5

After making changes, click "Publish" (top-right corner) to make updates live. Changes won’t appear to visitors until you publish.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Showing both many members and many services at once, which overwhelms visitors. Pick one primary path (member-first or service-first).
- Forgetting to use the eye icon to hide items you don’t want shown, causing duplicate or confusing options.
- Publishing layout changes but leaving old event types visible, leading to dead ends or inconsistent flows.
- Editing content in widgets but not clicking "Publish", so visitors still see the old content.
