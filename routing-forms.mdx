## What are Routing Forms?

With **Routing Forms**, you can direct visitors to the right person, team, or destination based on their responses—such as industry, company size, or specific needs.

Once your routing form and logic are set up, **lunacal collects visitor details and automatically routes them** to the correct event type or destination based on the rules you define.

This article explains how to **create a routing form from scratch** in Lunacal.

## How to Create a Routing Form

### Step 1 : Open Routing Forms

1. Go to [Event Types](https://app.lunacal.ai/event-types):
2. From the **left sidebar**, click on [Routing Forms](https://app.lunacal.ai/apps/routing-forms/forms)

### Step 2 : Edit form settings and add questions

Inside your routing form, you can:

1. Click \*\*Add Field \*\*to add question.
1. Enter the question name.
2. Select the question type (e.g. short text, number, dropdown, Long Text, multiple choice, Phone, Email).
3. Configure the question settings ( Deleting Question, Make Question Mandatory )
4. Select **Save**.

When you’re done adding questions, click **Routing**.

### Step 3 – Set up routing logic

#### Create a route

1. Open the **Routing Logic** tab.
2. Select **Add Route**.
3. Choose **Use form answers** to route based on visitor responses.
4. Set your conditions by selecting:
   - A **question**
   - A **qualifier** (equals, contains, etc.)
   - An **answer**
5. To refine your logic:
   - Use **AND / OR** to add more conditions
   - Click **Add another question** to include additional criteria

#### Choose a destination

For each route, select where qualified visitors should go:

- **Event Type** – Route visitors to a specific Lunacal event
- **Custom Message** – Show a message for unqualified visitors
- **External URL** – Redirect visitors to another webpage

Click **Save** when finished.

### Fallback route

Every routing form includes a **fallback route**.

- This route applies when a visitor’s answers don’t match any defined rules.
- By default, it displays a **custom message**.
- You can edit the message or change the destination by clicking the fallback route settings.

### Step 4 – Preview and publish your form

Before publishing, we recommend testing your routing form.

1. Click **Preview Form**.
2. Fill out the form to test routing behavior.
   - Responses submitted during preview are **not recorded**.
3. Once everything looks correct, select **Publish Form**.

### Step 5 – Share your routing form

After publishing, you’ll see sharing options including:

- **Share a link** – Copy and share the form URL
- **Add to website** – Embed the routing form directly
