## Step 4

Your calendar is now connected. If you have multiple calendars, pick where new events should be added. For example, switch the target to your “Calendar 2.0” if that’s your main booking calendar.\
Example: Keep personal events on “Personal” but set bookings to land on “Team Bookings” so your team sees them.

## Step 5

Add more calendars if needed. You can connect another Google Calendar or install new calendar apps like Apple Calendar or Outlook Calendar.\
Example: Connect Outlook Calendar from your employer and Google Calendar from your freelance work to prevent double-booking across both..
