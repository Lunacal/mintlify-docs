# Effortless International Team Meeting Scheduling

> In today's global work environment, scheduling meetings across different time zones can be challenging. This document provides a simple method for setting up meetings with international teammates without the hassle of endless emails. By using scheduling links and shared availability tools, you can easily coordinate and finalize meeting times that work for everyone.

### Step 1

To set up a meeting with teammates located in different countries, begin by navigating to one of their scheduling links. Append the usernames of the other team members you'd like to include in the meeting. For instance, to meet with Millie, Carlton, and John, add a plus sign and their usernames. Press enter, and Lunalcal will instantly display the shared availability of all parties, enabling you to select the most convenient time for everyone.
