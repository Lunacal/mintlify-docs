## Step 1

To set up a meeting with teammates located in different countries, begin by navigating to one of their scheduling links. Append the usernames of the other team members you'd like to include in the meeting. For instance, to meet with Millie Carter, and John, add a plus sign to one of their username. Press enter, and Lunacal will instantly display the shared availability.
