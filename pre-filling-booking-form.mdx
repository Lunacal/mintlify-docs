title: "Prefilling lunacal Booking Form"
description: "If you collect attendee details (like name, email, phone, etc.) on your own website form and then redirect users to a lunacal.ai booking embed, you can pre-populate the lunacal booking form with those values so attendees don't have to re-enter them. This makes scheduling smoother and increases conversions."
mode: "wide"

## What This Does

When a website visitor fills out your custom form, you can:

1. Send them to a **lunacal scheduling booking page** OR
2. Show your **lunacal embedded scheduler**

…and have fields like **name, email, phone, notes, or other custom fields** already filled in.

## How It Works

lunacal supports prefilling booking fields by passing values either: \\

1. via **URL query** **parameters** \
   OR\\
2. via **embed configuration** (if you embed lunacal directly on your site)

## 1. Prefill via URL Parameters (Scheduling Page & Embeded Page)

If your form submits to a landing page or redirects after submission, build the lunacal booking URL with query parameters.

🔗 Example Redirect URL

> https://lunacal.ai/your-username/your-event?name=John%20Doe&email=john%40example.com&attendee-phone=%2B919876543210

## **You have to use booking questions identifier (Internal label ) as query params**

### **Supported Prefill Fields**

**Example :**

| **Field**       | **Query Parameter ( Identifier )** |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Attendee name   | name                               |
| Attendee email  | email                              |
| Phone number    | attendee-phone                     |
| Comments        | notes                              |
| Custom question | yourCustomQuestionFieldIdentifier  |

{yourFieldIdentifier}

> Spaces must be URL-encoded (%20), and + in phone numbers must be URL-encoded as %2B.

## **2. Prefill in an Embedded lunacal Scheduler**

If you embed lunacal on your own page — inline or via a popup — you can pass prefill values directly in the embed configuration.

You don’t need to use URL parameters in this approach.

## **You have to use booking questions identifier (Internal label ) as key**

### Inline Embed Example (JavaScript)

```
<script src="https://lunacal.ai/embed.js"></script>
<div id="lunacal-scheduler"></div>
<script>
  lunacal.init({
    target: "#lunacal-scheduler",
    config: {
      attendee-name: "John Doe",
      email: "[email protected]",
      phone: "+919876543210",
      notes: "Filled from website form",

      // Any custom metadata or questions
      "metadata[campaign]": "summer-camp"
    }
  });
</script>
```

### Floating Button Popup Embed

```
<script src="https://lunacal.ai/embed.js"></script>
<script>
  lunacal.init({
    mode: "floatingButton",
    config: {
      name: "Mary Smith",
      email: "[email protected]",
      phone: "+919999999999",
      notes: "From homepage lead form"
    }
  });
</script>
