title: "Prefilling lunacal Booking Form"
description: "If you collect attendee details (like name, email, phone, etc.) on your own website form and then redirect users to a lunacal.ai booking embed, you can pre-populate the lunacal booking form with those values so attendees don't have to re-enter them. This makes scheduling smoother and increases conversions."

## What This Does

When a website visitor fills out your custom form, you can:

1. Send them to a **lunacal scheduling booking page**.\
   OR
1. Show your **lunacal embedded scheduler.**

…and have fields like **name, email, phone, notes, or other custom fields** already filled in.

## How It Works

lunacal supports prefilling booking fields by passing values either:

1. via **URL query** **parameters** \
   OR
2. via **embed configuration** (if you embed lunacal directly on your site)

## 1. Prefill via URL Parameters (Scheduling Page & Embeded Page)

You can pre-fill all the booking questions on the booking form by using their corresponding internal label that you can see in booking question tab.

e.g. for the following question (shown in screenshot below), the question would show up as ”What’s the main goal of this meeting?” and its internal label is ”main-goal”. So, we would use “main-goal” as query param name to prefill the field.

🔗 Example URL

> https://lunacal.ai/your-username/your-event?main-goal=Consultation

{yourFieldIdentifier}

> Spaces must be URL-encoded (%20), and + in phone numbers must be URL-encoded as %2B.

## **2. Prefill in an Embedded lunacal Calendar**

You can use the same query parameter method in the embed as well.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use query parameters, you can configure the values directly in the embed settings.

## **You have to use booking questions identifier (Internal label ) as key**

### Inline Embed Example (JavaScript)

```
  Lunacal.ns["your-event-slug"]("inline", {
        elementOrSelector: "#your-event-slug",
        config: {
          layout: "",
          // Add your booking questions here.
		  // Use the question’s internal label as the key,
	      // and set the value to the prefill text you want to pass.
          name: "pre-fill-name",
          email: "pre-fill-email",
          "custom-question": "pre-fill-custom-question",
          check: "pre-fill-check",
        },
        calLink: "your-event-slug",
      });
```
