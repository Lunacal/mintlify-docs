When visitors open your team booking page, they can either:

- Book directly with a specific team member, or
- Choose a specific event and get scheduled with the right team member.

> **Note:** Make sure your team members and event types are already created. Members without active event types or availability may not appear on the booking page.

## Step 1

Click "**Edit Team Booking**" Page from the top-right corner. This opens your team page editor with all sections in one place.

## Step 2

### Book a Member Directly

This section displays all team members you’ve added. Visitors can click an individual member to book directly with them. You can hide any member by clicking the eye icon (visibility toggle) on their profile card.

- **You can drag and rearrange team members to control the order they appear on your public booking page. Simply drag a member card and drop it into your preferred position.**

- **You can also hide or unhide the breadcrumb navigation (e.g., “Select Event Type \> Select Professional \> Select Time”) from the page settings if you prefer a cleaner booking flow.**

## Step 3

### Our Services

This block shows all event types created for the team. Visitors can click any event to book it directly. You can hide any event by clicking the eye icon (visibility toggle) on the event card.

- **You can also hide/unhide and reorder entire event cards to control which services are visible on the public booking page.**

## **Step 4**

### Widgets & Customization

> Widgets help answer common visitor questions before booking and improve conversion.

Add extra widgets like "**About Me", Video Embed, FAQs, or "Why Us?**" to personalize the page. Use short, clear content that helps the visitor decide quickly.

- **You can enable Event-Specific Widgets. When this option is turned on, you can show or hide widgets for individual event types instead of applying them across the entire team page. This allows more tailored content depending on the service selected.**


- **You can also choose to show or hide all widgets globally using the "Show Widgets" toggle in the editor.**

## Step 5

After making changes, click "**Publish**" (top-right corner) to make updates live. Changes won’t appear to visitors until you **publish**.

> **Tip:** Open the booking link in an incognito window to verify your changes as a visitor.

## Common mistakes to avoid

> If something doesn’t appear as expected, double-check visibility toggles and click Publish again.

- Showing both many members and many events at once, which overwhelms visitors. Pick one primary path (member-first or service-first).
- Forgetting to use the eye icon to hide items you don’t want shown, causing duplicate or confusing options.
- Publishing layout changes but leaving old event types visible, leading to dead ends or inconsistent flows.
- Editing content in widgets but not clicking "**Publish**", so visitors still see the old content.
