## **How to Access Team Bookings**

1. In your team workspace sidebar, click **Bookings**.
2. The list refreshes to show bookings for events that belong to your team’s workspace (not your personal events).

## **Edit, Reschedule, or Cancel a Team Booking**

Use the **Edit** menu on any booking in the list to:

- **Reschedule** — pick a new time and send the updated invite to the attendee(s)
- **Request a Reschedule** — prompt the attendee to choose a new time
- **Cancel** — remove the booking from the calendar and notify
- **Change Location** — update the meeting type (e.g., Zoom, Meet, physical address)

**After any change**, Lunacal automatically sends updated notifications/mails to attendees & hosts.

## **Booking Details & Full View**

Click a booking entry to open its detail panel. Here you can:

- See attendee contact info
- View which event type was booked
- See assigned team member(s)
- Copy conferencing links for meetings (Zoom, Meet, Teams, etc.)

This is helpful to prepare before a meeting starts.

## **Handling Unconfirmed Team Bookings**

The **Unconfirmed** tab shows bookings that haven’t been fully completed, such as:

- Bookings with **pending payment**
- Bookings awaiting **manual approval**

Review this section regularly so team members with booking privileges can follow up and convert them into confirmed meetings.

## **Past & Canceled Bookings**

- **Past:** Review completed meetings across the team; useful for reporting, notes, or CRM follow-up.
- **Canceled:** See meetings that were canceled, either by your team or by attendees — this can help you spot patterns in no-shows or reschedules.

## **Permissions & Editing Rights**

Team Owners and Admins can view all bookings and often can edit them.

However:

- Only the event **owner** or users with appropriate team roles can **edit or cancel** individual bookings

Always make sure you’re in the correct **team workspace** and have the required permissions before editing bookings.

## **Best Practices for Team Booking Management**

- Check **“Unconfirmed”** daily — don’t let pending actions accumulate.
- Standardize meeting **“Location”** defaults (e.g., Zoom for demos) to reduce errors.
- Use **reschedule requests** when timing shifts instead of canceling outright.
- **Review** the **Canceled** tab weekly to identify possible booking friction points.

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- Editing booking details directly in a connected calendar instead of through the team **Bookings** page.
- Forgetting to send updated notifications after rescheduling or canceling.
- Ignoring unconfirmed bookings, leading to lost revenue or missed meetings.
