## Edit Booking Page (Per Member)

Clicking **Edit Booking Page** allows you to customize that individual member’s public booking profile.

You can modify:

- Public display information
- Profile details
- How they appear on the team page
- How their public booking page will look like

Important:

If a member is:

- Hidden from booking page (via Team Members tab)
- Not assigned to events
- Has scheduling disabled

They may not appear publicly even if their profile is configured.

## Team Event Types Section

Beside members, you’ll see the list of team event types just click on "Team event types.

These are the events that:

- Appear on the public team page
- Can be booked by visitors

Only published event types will be visible.

## How Visibility Works (Important Logic)

A team member will appear on the team booking page only if:

1. They are not hidden from booking page
2. They are assigned to at least one event
3. Scheduling is not disabled
4. They have availability configured

If any of the above conditions are not met, the member may not appear or may not show available slots.

# Best Practices

- Hide internal-only members from the booking page.
- Disable scheduling instead of removing members when they are temporarily unavailable.
- Regularly review assigned events to ensure accurate public visibility.
- Test the **View Team Page** after making changes.
