Each workspace represents a team, department, or organization. Inside a workspace, you can manage:

- Shared event types
- Team bookings
- Member availability
- Integrations
- Branding & domain
- Permissions

Workspaces are ideal for service businesses, agencies, sales teams, coaching teams, and any organization with multiple schedulers.

## **What is a Workspace?**

Once you switch to a team workspace, your entire dashboard updates to reflect that team’s data — including events, bookings, members, and settings.
