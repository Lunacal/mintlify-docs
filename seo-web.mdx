Use this to control how your event page appears on Google and when shared on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, X, or email. It improves click-throughs and sets clear expectations for visitors. 

**What this feature does (and why use it)**

**"Meta Title"**: The headline search engines show. It also appears on the browser tab. A clear, specific title helps people choose your page over others.

**"Meta Description"**: A short summary below the title in search results. It tells users what they’ll get after clicking. Good descriptions boost click-through rates.

**"Social Preview Image"**: The thumbnail shown when your link is shared on social platforms or chat apps. A relevant image makes your link stand out and signals trust. 📷

**Example (local clinic):**

**"Meta Title"**: “Pediatric Consultation

**"Meta Description"**: “Book a 30-minute pediatric consult. In-clinic and video options. Insurance accepted.”

**"Social Preview Image"** : A clean banner with clinic logo + “Pediatric Consultation”.

**Step 1**

</Frame>

**Step 5**

In "Advanced" scroll down and update the following fields in "webpage_seo":

**"Meta Title"** → Keep it under 55–60 characters so it doesn’t get cut in Google. Put the event name first, then your name/brand or location for context.

Example (agency): “Strategy Call — Brand Positioning Audit | BrightLabs”

**"Meta Description"** → Aim for 140–160 characters. State who it’s for, what happens on the call, and any key qualifier (duration, format, outcome). Example (coach): “Book a 45-minute career coaching session. Get role clarity, resume fixes, and an action plan.”

**"Social Preview Image"**→ Use 1200×630 px (or similar 1.91:1) with readable text. Include your logo, event name, and a short benefit. Keep margins wide so text isn’t cropped. Example (therapist): A calm background with “Intro Therapy Session — 30 min” + clinic logo.

**More examples**

**Startup demo:** 

"Meta Title": “Product Demo — AI Reporting | Acme Analytics” 

"Meta Description": “Live 30-minute walkthrough. See automated dashboards, alerts, and team sharing.” 

"Social Preview Image": Product UI screenshot with “Live Demo” tag.

Fitness trainer: "Meta Title": “Personal Training — First Session | Maya Fit (Bengaluru)” "Meta Description": “60-minute assessment + plan. Studio or video. Limited slots this week.” "Social Preview Image": Trainer photo with “First Session — 60 min”. 💪

**Common mistakes to avoid**

Stuffing keywords in "Meta Title" (hard to read, lower clicks). Use a clear event name + brand/location.

Writing vague "Meta Description" (e.g., “Best service ever”). Describe the session, duration, and outcome.

Uploading a low-contrast "Social Preview Image" with tiny text; it will be unreadable on mobile previews.

Forgetting to "Save", then testing the old preview.

Reusing the same "Meta Title" for multiple events, which makes search results look duplicate and confusing.
