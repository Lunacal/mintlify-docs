# Team Members (Workspace)

The **Team Members** section allows you to manage everyone inside your workspace.

From here, you can:

- Add new team members
- Manage roles
- Control booking visibility
- Enable or disable scheduling
- Assign event types
- Configure individual availability

This section is available inside a **Team Workspace** only.

## Accessing Team Members

1. Switch to your **Team Workspace**
2. Click **Team Members** from the left sidebar

You’ll see a list of all members with:

- Name & email
- Role (Owner / Admin / Member)
- Status (Active)
- Assigned Events count

## Adding a New Team Member

To invite someone:

1. Click **\+ New Team Member**
2. Enter their email address
3. Select their role
4. Send invitation

Once they accept, they will appear in the Team Members list.

> Only Owners and Admins can invite members.

## Managing Team Members (Three-Dot Menu)

Next to each member, click the **⋯ (three dots)** menu to access management options.

## 1. Edit Role

Change the member’s role:

- **Owner** – Full control (can disband team)
- **Admin** – Can manage events and members
- **Member** – Can manage assigned events only

Use this when promoting or restricting access.

## 2. Hide from Booking Page

This removes the member from the **public team booking page**.

Use this when:

- A member should not appear publicly
- Internal team members shouldn’t be bookable directly

Hidden members can still:

- Be assigned to events
- Receive bookings (if assigned)

They just won’t appear publicly.

## 3. Disable Scheduling

This temporarily prevents the member from receiving new bookings.

Use this when:

- A member is on leave
- Temporarily unavailable
- Transitioning out of the team

Important:

- Existing bookings remain unchanged
- They simply won’t receive new ones

## 4. Remove Member

This permanently removes the user from the workspace.

What happens:

- They lose access to the team workspace
- They are unassigned from team events
- Future bookings may require reassignment

Past bookings remain in history.

## Clicking on a Team Member (Member Profile Page)

When you click a member’s name, you open their detailed profile.

You’ll see three tabs:

- Profile
- Availability
- Assigned Event Types

## 1. Profile Tab

Here you can modify:

- Full name, Description, Booking Link, Designation
- Profile photo
- Contact information
- Public booking page details

Changes here affect how the member appears on booking pages.

## 2. Availability Tab

This controls when the member is available for team events.

You can:

- Create new availability schedules
- Modify working hours
- Set different time blocks per day
- Delete old schedules

Important Logic:

Team event availability depends on:

- Event-level availability
- Member availability
- Connected calendar availability

If a member is unavailable here, they will not receive bookings — even if the event is active.

## 3. Assigned Event Types Tab

Here you control which team events this member participates in.

You can:

- Assign event types
- Unassign event types

This determines:

- Whether they appear in Round Robin events
- Whether they are included in Collective events
- Whether they can host specific event types

If a member is not assigned to an event:

- They will not receive bookings for that event

## How Team Member Settings Affect Booking Behavior

Understanding this logic prevents confusion:

| Setting                  | Effect                                 |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Hidden from booking page | Not publicly visible                   |
| Disabled scheduling      | No new bookings assigned               |
| Not assigned to event    | Cannot receive bookings for that event |
| No availability set      | No time slots shown                    |
| Calendar not connected   | Conflicts may not block                |

## Best Practices

- Use **Disable Scheduling** instead of removing members temporarily.
- Always configure **availability before assigning events**.
- Review assigned events when promoting or changing roles.
- Hide internal-only members from the booking page.

## Common Mistakes

❌ Assigning an event but not setting availability\
❌ Leaving a member visible publicly but not assigning events\
❌ Removing a member without checking future bookings\
❌ Forgetting to disable scheduling when someone goes on leave

If you want, next we can:

- Add a “Role Permissions Table” specific to this page
- Add a booking flow diagram (how assignment resolves)
- Or tighten this into a more minimal, product-style version

Tell me which direction your senior prefers:\
**More detailed** or **more concise but sharp.**
