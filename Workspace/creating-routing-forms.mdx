The **Routing Forms** tab allows you to create qualification forms that automatically route visitors to the correct team member or event type based on their responses.

This is ideal for:

- Sales teams
- Support teams
- Agencies
- Multi-service businesses

Instead of showing all event types directly, visitors first complete a form. Based on their answers, Lunacal directs them to the appropriate booking page.

## What Are Team Routing Forms?

A **Team Routing Form** is a pre-booking form that:

1. Collects information from visitors
2. Applies routing rules
3. Redirects them to:
   - A specific team event type
   - A specific team member

Routing happens automatically based on logic you define.

## Accessing Routing Forms

1. Switch to your **Team Workspace**
2. Click **Routing Forms** from the sidebar
3. Click **New**
4. Enter "title" & "description"

Routing forms created here apply only to this workspace.

## Creating a Team Routing Form

When creating a routing form, you configure:

### 1. Form Fields

Add qualification fields such as:

- Name
- Email
- Company size
- Budget range
- Service interest
- Custom dropdowns
- Multiple choice questions

These fields determine how routing rules work.

### 2. Routing Logic

Define rules such as:

- If _Company Size = Enterprise_ → Route to **Enterprise Sales Event**
- If _Service = Design_ → Route to **Design Consultation Event**
- If _Budget \< X_ → Route to **Junior Consultant**

Rules can direct users to:

- A specific team event type
- A specific team member
- Different event types based on answer combinations

## Publishing the Routing Form

Once configured:

- Publish the form
- Copy its public link
- Or embed it on your website

Visitors will:

1. Fill out the form
2. Be automatically redirected
3. See only the appropriate booking options

## Managing Team Routing Forms

Inside the Routing Forms tab, you can:

- Edit existing forms
- Duplicate forms
- Unpublish forms
- Delete forms

Unpublishing a form stops visible publicly.

## Best Practices for Team Routing

- Keep forms short (3–5 questions max)
- Route by qualification, not preference
- Test every logic path before publishing
- Ensure routed members have availability set
- Use routing to reduce booking friction

## Common Mistakes

Routing interacts with:

- Assigned event types
- Member availability
- Scheduling status
- Hidden/visible member settings

If a routing rule sends someone to:

- A disabled member → No time slots will show
- An unassigned event → It won’t work
- A member without availability → No bookable slots

Always test routing after publishing.

## When to Use Team Routing Forms

Use team routing forms if:

- You want to qualify leads before booking
- You offer multiple services
- You have multiple sales reps
- You want high-value prospects routed to senior staff
- You need structured intake before scheduling
