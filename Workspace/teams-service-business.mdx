## **What is a Workspace?**

A **Workspace** is a shared environment where a team operates together.\
Once you switch to a team workspace, your entire dashboard updates to reflect that team’s data — including events, bookings, members, and settings.

---

## **Switching Between Workspaces**

You can switch workspaces using the **dropdown in the top-left corner** of your dashboard.

- Select your personal workspace or any team workspace you’re part of
- When you switch to a team workspace, all sections (events, bookings, settings, etc.) will show **team-level data**

---

## **Workspace Dashboard Sections**

When you’re inside a team workspace, you’ll see the following tabs on the left sidebar:

---

### **Event Types**
