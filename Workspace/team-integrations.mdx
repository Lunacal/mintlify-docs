The **Integrations** tab inside a Workspace allows you to connect apps and tools that power team scheduling.

Integrations at the team level ensure:

- Accurate availability
- Automatic meeting link generation
- Conflict prevention
- Smooth coordination across multiple team members

## Accessing Team Integrations

1. Switch to your **Team Workspace**
2. Click **Integrations** from the sidebar

All integrations configured here apply to the team context — not your personal account.

## Calendar Integrations

Calendars prevent double bookings and ensure availability is accurate.

Each team member should connect their own calendar.

### How It Works

- When a booking is made, Lunacal checks:
  - Event availability
  - Member availability
  - Connected calendar events

If a time slot conflicts with a calendar event, it will not appear as available.

### Important Notes

- Calendar connections are **per member**, not shared.
- If a member does not connect a calendar:
  - Conflicts cannot be automatically blocked.
- Team admins cannot override a member’s calendar conflicts.

## Video Conferencing Integrations

You can connect tools such as:

- Zoom
- Google Meet
- Microsoft Teams
- Facetime

When enabled:

- Meeting links are generated automatically
- Links are included in confirmation emails
- Links appear in booking details
- for facetime link isn't automatically generated you've to setup manually

## How Team Integrations Affect Booking Logic

Team bookings depend on:

- Event configuration
- Member availability
- Connected calendars
- Assigned event types

If an integration is missing:

- No automatic meeting link will be generated
- Calendar conflicts may not block time
- Manual steps may be required

Always test after connecting integrations.

## Managing Integrations

Inside the Integrations tab, you can:

- Connect new apps
- Reconnect expired accounts
- Disconnect integrations
- View connection status

If an integration shows an error, reconnect it immediately to avoid scheduling issues.

## Best Practices for Team Integrations

- Ensure **every active member connects their calendar**
- Reconnect expired tokens promptly
- Standardize one video tool across the team
- Test booking flow after connecting new integrations

## Common Issues

### Time Slots Showing Incorrectly

Likely causes:

- Member calendar not connected
- Calendar sync delay
- Availability misconfiguration

### No Meeting Link Generated

Likely cause:

- Video conferencing integration not connected

### Double Bookings

Likely cause:

- Member calendar not connected or not synced properly

## Personal vs Team Integrations

Integrations inside a Team Workspace:

- Do not affect your personal workspace
- Apply only to team-level events
- Require each member to authenticate individually (for calendars)

## When Should You Configure Team Integrations?

Immediately after:

- Creating a workspace
- Inviting team members
- Creating team event types

Integrations should be configured before publishing your team booking page.

If you want, I can now:

- Tighten this into a more minimal SaaS-style doc
- Or expand with troubleshooting workflows and diagnostic steps
