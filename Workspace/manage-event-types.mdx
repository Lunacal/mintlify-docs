Creating an event is easy. But configuring it properly? That’s what makes your team scheduling smooth, scalable, and professional.

Inside your **Workspace → Event Types**, you can create different types of team events.

But configuring them correctly depends on the type of event you choose.

This guide explains exactly what to configure for:

- Managed Events
- Round Robin Events
- Collective Events

---

## Step 1: Understand Your Event Type First

Before touching settings, ask:

_How should bookings be assigned?_

### 1. Managed Event

Team owner controls the event.\
This works like a standard event but inside a team.

Use this when:

- One specific person owns the meeting
- Example: CEO Call, Founder Strategy Session

---

### 2. Round Robin Event

Bookings are automatically distributed among assigned members.

Use this when:

- You want equal distribution
- Example: Sales Demo Calls
- Multiple reps available, system assigns automatically

---

### 3. Collective Event

All assigned members must attend the same meeting.

Use this when:

- You need multiple people present
- Example: Technical + Sales joint call
- Panel interviews

---

## Step 2: Configure Each Tab Properly

Now let’s go tab by tab — but from a practical setup perspective.

---

## Event Setup (Start Here)

This tab defines what the event is.

Configure:

- Event Name
- Duration
- Description
- Meeting Location
- Group or Package (if needed)

Important:

For Round Robin or Collective events, do NOT worry about distribution here.\
Distribution is controlled inside **Assigned Members**.

This tab is only about how the event looks and behaves publicly.

---

## Availability (Very Important for Team Events)

Here’s where most confusion happens.

Availability depends on event type:

### For Managed Events

Availability is based on that assigned member.

You can:

- Use team default availability
- Override it specifically for this event

---

### For Round Robin

System checks availability of all assigned members.

If at least one member is available → slot shows.

---

### For Collective

System checks overlap availability.

Only time slots where **all assigned members are free** will appear.

If you don’t see slots:

- Check each member’s availability inside Team Members
- Check time zone conflicts

This is the most common issue users face.

---

## Assigned Members (Controls Distribution)

This tab defines who handles the event.

Now it behaves differently per event type:

---

### Managed Event

Assign only ONE primary member.

If you assign multiple by mistake, behavior may not match expectation.

---

### Round Robin

Assign multiple members.

The system will:

- Distribute bookings evenly
- Skip unavailable members
- Rotate automatically

If bookings are not distributing:

- Check member availability
- Check booking limits
- Ensure members are active

---

### Collective

Assign all required participants.

The system will:

- Only show slots where everyone is free
- Book the same meeting on all assigned calendars

If no slots show:

- Check overlapping availability
- Check calendar conflicts

---

## Booking Limits (Prevents Chaos)

This tab protects your team.

Set:

- Buffer time
- Advance notice
- Daily booking limits
- Future booking window
- Required booking questions

For Round Robin especially:\
If one member is overloaded, check:

- Max bookings per day
- Individual availability
- Event limits

---

## Payments (If Applicable)

Enable this only if:

- You charge per session
- You sell consulting
- You offer paid discovery calls

For internal team meetings → leave this disabled.

---

## Workflows (Automation Layer)

This controls:

- Reminder emails
- Internal notifications
- Follow-up sequences

Example:

- Send Slack notification when new Round Robin booking is made
- Send reminder 24 hours before meeting

If notifications aren’t working:\
Check workflow trigger conditions.

---

## Integrations

Important for:

- CRM auto-updates
- Lead tracking
- Marketing attribution

Especially useful for Round Robin sales teams.

---

## Advanced Settings (Power Controls)

Only adjust these if needed.

Common useful settings:

- Disable rescheduling
- Require manual approval (good for Collective)
- Redirect after booking
- Custom slot intervals

If event behavior feels “wrong,” check here.

---

## Common Problems & Why They Happen

### No slots showing

- Collective event with no overlapping availability
- Team member availability misconfigured
- Booking window too restricted

---

### Round Robin not distributing equally

- One member unavailable
- One member hit max bookings limit
- Member not properly assigned

---

### Only one member getting all bookings

- Others have limited availability
- Others have calendar conflicts
- Booking limits misconfigured

---

## Final Advice for Team Events

When configuring:

1. Choose correct event type first
2. Assign members correctly
3. Double-check availability
4. Then configure booking limits
5. Test with a real booking link

Team events are powerful — but small configuration mistakes cause most confusion.
