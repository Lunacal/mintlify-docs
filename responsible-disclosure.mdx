## Our Commitment

We actively work to safeguard our systems against the latest security threats. Despite our best efforts, vulnerabilities may occasionally be discovered. When this happens, we encourage security researchers, customers, and partners to report these issues to us responsibly.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue affecting lunacal.ai products, services, or infrastructure, please contact us immediately with the relevant details. This allows us to analyze and resolve the vulnerability before any public disclosure.

### Reporting Process

- Please send a detailed report to our dedicated security disclosure email: [support@lunacal.ai](mailto:support@lunacal.ai).
- Include a clear description of the vulnerability, the affected systems or products, and step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- We recommend avoiding attachments and including most of the information directly in your email.
- For proof-of-concept demonstrations, recorded videos can be shared as private links from trusted platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.

## In-scope

- app.lunacal.ai/*
- lunacal.ai/*

## Report Eligibility

- Be the first to report a vulnerability.
- Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
- If multiple vulnerabilities reported from the same root cause, they will be considered a single issue, and only the first valid report will qualify for the Hall of Fame, If the root cause is the same and endpoints are different within the same application, it will be treated as a duplicate.
- Provide high quality reports with clear and comprehensive reproducible steps. High quality submissions allow our team to better understand the issue and relay the bug to the internal teams to fix it quickly.

### Safe Communication

To keep your communication secure, we encourage using encrypted email or our secure help desk portal when submitting sensitive information.

## Our Request to Researchers

- Please give us a reasonable time to investigate and address the reported vulnerability before publicly disclosing any details.
- Avoid testing beyond what is necessary to confirm the vulnerability to prevent disruption to our services.
- Do not share vulnerabilities or exploit details publicly until we have resolved the issue.
