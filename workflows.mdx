## Step 2

Provide a unique name for your workflow in the designated field.

  ![](/images/setup_workflows/2.webp)
</Frame>

Determine the event type to which the workflow will apply. For instance i'm selecting "Meeting", You can also select multiple events.

## Step 4

Choose when the workflow should be triggered

</Frame>

## Step 5

Pick a trigger: “Before an event starts”, “When event is canceled”, “When new event is booked”, “After event ends”, or “When event is rescheduled”.\
Example: Send a reminder “Before an event starts” so attendees don’t miss the call.

## Step 6

If using a “Before an event starts” trigger, you have to set the time (e.g., 2 Hours).\
Example: For first-time “Meeting” calls, set 24 Hours so people prep earlier.

## Step 7

Specify the recipients of the workflow trigger.

## Step 8

Select “attendees”, “host”, or add a specific email.\
Example: Add your coordinator’s email so they get alerts for last-minute changes.

## Step 9

There are multiple template options to set for attendee workflows,

  ![](/templates.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 10

Insert variables as needed (e.g., ATTENDEE_NAME, EVENT_TIME, LOCATION_LINK).\
Example: Include LOCATION_LINK so Zoom/Meet joins are one click

**Common mistakes to avoid**\
• Picking a trigger but forgetting to set time for “Before an event starts”, which sends nothing.\
• Selecting “host” only when you meant to notify “attendees” as well.\
• Leaving variables blank (for example, missing LOCATION_LINK) so emails are unclear.\
• Creating overlapping reminders (for example, two reminders at 1 Hour) and spamming recipients.

**Good defaults to start with**\
• Triggers: “When new event is booked” (instant confirmation) and “Before an event starts” at 24 Hours + 1 Hour.\
• Recipients: “attendees” for reminders, “host” for reschedule/cancel alerts.\
• Variables: always include ATTENDEE_NAME, EVENT_TIME, LOCATION_LINK.\
• Naming: include event and timing in the name (for example, “Meeting — Reminder 24h”).
