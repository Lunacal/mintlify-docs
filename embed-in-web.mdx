Embedding your lunacal scheduling page directly into your website allows visitors to book meetings without leaving your site. This can increase conversions by removing friction and keeping visitors engaged where they already are.

## Step 1

Use “**Embed Event Into Your Website**” to place your booking flow directly on your site so visitors can book without leaving. You’ll use the “**Embed**” section to generate and copy a small HTML snippet.

  ![](/images/embed_in_web/image1.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 2

Next, click on the "**Embed**" option.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/embed_in_web/image2.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 3

Then, select "**Add to Website.**"

  ![](/images/embed_in_web/image3.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 4

You'll be provided to copy the **HTML Code**, You can also change the color for calendar.

  ![](/images/embed_in_web/image4.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 5

Paste this HTML into your site where you want the event or calendar to appear (e.g., your “**Contact Us**” page).\

- **Example 1**: An agency adds the “Discovery Call” event to the Pricing page so leads can book right after reviewing plans.
  
> After embedding, any changes you make to the event (such as availability, title, or description) will automatically reflect inside the embed — no need to replace the code again.

> **Important:** Embeds rely on raw HTML code. Some site builders (especially free landing page builders or restricted editor modes) remove or block HTML embed code. Make sure to use a “Custom HTML”, “HTML”, or “Code” block when pasting the snippet.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Pasting into a builder block that strips HTML—use a proper “HTML” or “Custom code” block.
- Embedding the wrong event (e.g., copying a test event’s code), causing wrong durations or questions.
- Forgetting to republish or clear cache/CDN, so the embed doesn’t appear for visitors.
- Using low-contrast colors that make the calendar hard to read on mobile.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Place the embed above the fold on a dedicated “Book a Call” or “Contact Us” page.
- Keep width at 100% of the container and give enough height so the calendar isn’t cut off.
- Match the calendar color to your brand and add a one-line heading (“Pick a time that works for you”).
- Test once on desktop and mobile to confirm the widget loads and scrolls smoothly
