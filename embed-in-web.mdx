## Step 1

Use “Embed Event Into Your Website” to place your booking flow directly on your site so visitors can book without leaving. You’ll use the “Embed” section to generate and copy a small HTML snippet.

</Frame>

## Step 2

Next, click on the "Embed" option.

<Frame>
  ![](/images/embed_in_web/image2.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 3

Then, select "Add to Website."

</Frame>

## Step 4

You'll be provided to copy the HTML Code, You can also change the color for calendar.

  ![](/images/embed_in_web/image4.webp)
</Frame>

## Step 5

Paste this HTML into your site where you want the event or calendar to appear (e.g., your “Contact Us” page).\
Example 1: An agency adds the “Discovery Call” event to the Pricing page so leads can book right after reviewing plans. \
Example 2: A tutor drops the snippet into a WordPress HTML block in the sidebar to show weekly availability.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

- Pasting into a builder block that strips HTML—use a proper “HTML” or “Custom code” block.
- Embedding the wrong event (e.g., copying a test event’s code), causing wrong durations or questions.
- Forgetting to republish or clear cache/CDN, so the embed doesn’t appear for visitors.
- Using low-contrast colors that make the calendar hard to read on mobile.

**Good defaults to start with**

- Place the embed above the fold on a dedicated “Book a Call” or “Contact Us” page.
- Keep width at 100% of the container and give enough height so the calendar isn’t cut off.
- Match the calendar color to your brand and add a one-line heading (“Pick a time that works for you”).
- Test once on desktop and mobile to confirm the widget loads and scrolls smoothly
